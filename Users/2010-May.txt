IMPORTANT DATES

* Submission of abstracts: May 17, 2010
* Submission of papers: May 24, 2010
* Author notification: Jul 5, 2010

SCOPE

Generative and component approaches are revolutionizing software
development similar to how automation and components revolutionized
manufacturing. Generative Programming (concerning programs that
synthesize other programs), Component Engineering (concerning
modularity in application design), and Domain-Specific Languages
(DSLs) (concerning compact domain-specific notations for expressing
programs) are key technologies for automating program development.

The International Conference on Generative Programming and Component
Engineering is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in
techniques that, through deploying components and program generation,
increase programmer productivity, improve software quality, and
shorten the time-to-market of software products.  In addition to
exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative and component-based
software, our goal is to foster further cross-fertilization between
the software engineering and the programming languages research
communities.

SUBMISSIONS

Research papers:

10 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style (sigplanconf.cls) reporting
original research results that contribute to scientific knowledge in
the areas listed below (the PC chair can advise on appropriateness).

Tool demonstrations:

Tool demonstrations should present tools that implement novel
generative and component-based software engineering techniques, and
are available for use. Any of the GPCE'10 topics of interest are
appropriate areas for research demonstrations.  Purely commercial tool
demonstrations will not be accepted. Submissions should contain a tool
description of 4 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style (sigplanconf.cls)
and a demonstration outline of up to 2 pages text plus 2 pages screen
shots. The four page description will, if the demonstration is accepted,
be published in the proceedings. The 2+2 page demonstration outline
will only be used by the PC for evaluating the submission.

hi, admin

I just want to use strategoxt to solve some GP problem. But I stucked during
install strategoxt source code. My system is Ubuntu 10.04 desk, my CPU is
intel T7300(32bit intel). I download the all the source code on your web
follow the install instruction to setup aterm-2.5, sdf2-bundle-2.4 and
strategoxt-0.17. I also use "apt-get install libtool" install libtool. But
from certain step, my computer is just stop at the make.
after I input

$ tar zxf strategoxt-*version*.tar.gz
$ cd strategoxt-*version*
$ ./configure --with-aterm=/usr/local --with-sdf=/usr/local
$ make
after the make command, the execute process always stuck at link in xtc package.
this is the error:

libtool: link: ( cd ".libs" && rm -f "libstratego-sdf.la" && ln -s
"../libstratego-sdf.la" "libstratego-sdf.la" )

You can see I just stuck at the link process.
At this place, one of my CPU is working 20 minutes without any reply,
just stuck here.

After I interrupted the process, I can manually execute command
gcc -Wall -Wno-unused-label -Wno-unused-variable -Wnuo-unused-function
-Wno-unused-parameter
-DDEFAULT_XTC_REPOSITORY=\"/usr/local/share/strategoxt/XTC\" -g -O2 -o

/downloadtmp/strategoxt-0.17/stratego-libraries/runtime/lib/.libs/libstratego-runtime.so
/usr/local/lib/libATerm.so -lm -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/local/lib

It is ok. But, I still could not go further of "make", I mean after
that, I try to execute the program again, the make process is still
stuck after enterning
`/downloadtmp/strategoxt-0.17/xtc/src'


below, I'll attached the makefile in /xtc/src directory and config.log
in strategoxt-0.17 directory

Best regards

Subject: [Stratego Users] Stratego with Delphi?
Message-ID: <AANLkTilYCLyVP-IBbxwWXzX_Y3PAgl2kCsZmEJFZjLlP@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm doing a master thesis at Utrecht University and my topic is
transforming a sizeable Delphi application (~200k lines). The basic
idea is to try and untangle the gui part of the code from the rest,
producing a client/server model. The determination would be done based
on type information. I was wondering if Stratego might be a good fit
for this job. What would be needed to use Stratego with Delphi in this
way and do you know of anyone using Stratego with Delphi?


Regards,
Martin Matusiak

Hi Martin,

You would need an SDF definition for Delphi.

Next, you'd need to write a type checker. No idea how hard that would
be (depends on size of the language and difficulty of the type
system).

There is a nice idiom for developing type systems now and making an
interactive IDE that might be useful in your re-engineering task:

    http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax

Whether the task is feasible at all depends more on the properties of
the code base than the transformation tool you would use.

cheers,

-- Eelco

Subject: [Stratego Users] The Spoofax Language Workbench and Stratego for
	Java
Message-ID: <201005281608.o4SG8Abv022615@smtp1.infopact.nl>

Hi list,

It's been a while since we had a big announcement here, but there have been many exciting recent developments that we would like share with you.

=== Stratego and SDF for Java ===

Stratego and SDF have now gained new Java implementations in the form of STRJ and JSGLR (both available from strategoxt.org). STRJ generates Java code from Stratego programs, and JSGLR is a Java-based parser for SDF parse tables. While JSGLR existed for a while, it is now considered mature enough for interactive use. These implementations won't necessarily replace the existing C-based versions, but their portability can make them attractive alternatives.

=== Building languages and transformations in Eclipse with Spoofax ===

We're pleased to announce the 0.5 release of the Spoofax language workbench, an Eclipse plugin that integrates Java versions of Stratego and SDF into Eclipse. Spoofax can be used to develop new languages and transformations based on SDF and Stratego in the Eclipse environment.

IDE support has become essential for developers to be productive with programming languages. Spoofax provides IDE support for Stratego and SDF for developers of languages and transformations. It can show the abstract syntax of code fragments, apply transformations to any input, etc. It also aids in the development of IDE support for new languages: from the first version of an SDF grammar, an editor can be instantiated for the language and used *side-by-side* with the definition in Eclipse. Using Stratego, the editor can be enhanced with transformations and semantic editor services such as reference resolving and content completion.

Spoofax can be downloaded from http://www.spoofax.org and includes Stratego and SDF. When installed in Eclipse, the plugin provides a "New project" wizard that creates a new skeleton project illustrating some of the Spoofax features. The website also includes a tour (http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax/Tour) further showcasing the features of the workbench. For migrating C-based Stratego projects to Spoofax, please read the FAQ at http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax/FAQ or just post here or on the #stratego IRC channel in case of other questions. 

An overview of the architecture of Spoofax and how Spoofax can be used in the development of new languages and IDE services is given in the paper The Spoofax Language Workbench: Rules for Declarative Specification of Languages and IDEs by myself and Eelco Visser, accepted for publication at SPLASH/OOPSLA 2010 (http://researchr.org/publication/KatsVisser2010). Further documentation can be found on the Spoofax website.

cheers,

Lennart
