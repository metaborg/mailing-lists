Subject: [Stratego Users] building outside of Eclipse
Message-ID: <AANLkTim10c9bD=kYywfU1rDKqkFC4kM9zQGEUHpph=p1@mail.gmail.com>

I used the Strategy/IMP workbench to create a plugin, and it has gone
swimingly. Now I would like to build and test the code from a
continuous builder, and I am running into trouble.


The plugin has generated some Ant build files, and I tried to use
those. However, they seem to expect that ant is run with extra jars on
its classpath. This leads me to two questions:

1. Is there any hope of building the non-Eclipse-specific parts using
this build file, or do I have to supply all the Eclipse dependencies,
too? I downloaded a strategoxt.jar that holds all the dependencies
that appear necessary for the parts I'd really like to regression
test.

2. Is there any way to use the generated build files without having to
set a CLASSPATH environment variable first? I guess I can make a
script file to supply the environment variable, but it would be nicer
if a simple "ant test" were possible to make work.

I have written some test cases for the parser, and I can run them via
a sequence of IDE commands, but now I'm stuck running them from the
command line. I guess I can just write a new build file from scratch,
but that would mean that key partss of the distributed plugin are
built with a different build file than is used for regression testing,
which is not ideal.

We have just started continuously building Spoofax and some Spoofax
based projects in our buildfarm. I have made a description of this at
http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax/ContinuousBuildingSpoofax

It is basically a description of how to build Spoofax projects from the
command-line. It uses Maven, Tycho and Ant.

As described on the link I posted, section 'Running ant builds'. However,
at the moment, you will need to pass 4 jars to ant.

At the moment it is not yet possible. We should look how to make this
easier.

There are also some small remarks on tests in the link. However, as we
just started building the plugins this way, it is work in progress.

Hope this gets you started, and please let us know how it works out.

Fantastic!  Thanks very much for these notes. They have just the
pointers I need.

I see that you are keeping around an Eclipse installation to deal with
the Eclipse dependencies. That makes sense, because I suppose that's
the easiest way to build an Eclipse plugin. I'm happy to see that the
bulk of the build, however, only requires four jars as dependencies.
For my needs, I'll probably check in those four jars for the main
build and test, so as to minimize accidental dependencies.

I won't immediately use the Maven part, because my group is one of the
last Java shops on the planet not using Maven. However, it's great to
see how straightforward it is to do so.

Good for you. Maven is 3vil!

(Okay, so that was not very constructive, but I just had to vent my
frustration against what must be the most hyped and at the same time
suckiest build system I have suffered yet.)

And now back to our regular programming...

[Apologies for multiple copies]

========================================================================
JOURNAL OF APPLIED LOGIC
Special Issue on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/tkutsia/jal-wwv.html
========================================================================

SCOPE
-----
This special issue of the Journal of Applied Logic is related
to the topics of the workshop WWV'10: Automated Specification
and Verification of Web Systems, which took place in Vienna on
July 30-31, 2010. Both participants of the workshop and other
authors are invited to submit contributions.

The increased complexity of Web sites and the explosive growth
of Web-based applications has turned their design and
construction into a challenging problem. Nowadays, many
companies have diverted their Web sites into interactive,
completely-automated, Web-based applications (such as Amazon,
on-line banking, or travel agencies) with a high complexity
that requires appropriate specification and verification
techniques and tools. Systematic, formal approaches to the
analysis and verification can address the problems of this
particular domain with automated and reliable tools that also
incorporate semantic aspects.

We solicit original papers on logic-based methods and
techniques applied to Web sites, Web services or Web-based
applications, such as:

  * Rule-based approaches to Web systems analysis, certification,
    specification, verification, and optimization
  * Algebraic methods for verification and certification of Web
    systems
  * Formal models for describing and reasoning about Web systems
  * Model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web systems
  * Abstract interpretation and program transformation applied to
    the semantic Web
  * Intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for Web
    specifications authoring
  * Web quality and Web metrics
  * Web usability and accessibility
  * Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications

SUBMISSION
----------
We expect original articles (typically 15-25 pages; submission
of larger papers will be evaluated depending on editorial
constraints) that present high-quality contributions that have
not been previously published and that must not be
simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.

Submissions must comply with JAL's author guidelines. They must
be written in English and should be prepared using the Elsevier
LaTeX package.

Submissions are encouraged via the EasyChair submission system:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jalwwv2010.

IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
  * Submission of papers: March 7, 2011.
  * Notification: June 6, 2011.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Problems with separate parse table compilation
Message-ID: <14D9C2AC-B787-4E65-A09B-3B557023F051@informatik.uni-marburg.de>

Hi everyone,

I tried to separately compile parse tables [1] in my SugarJ project [2] using the implementation from the Stratego svn [3]. Unfortunately, I have run into several problems:

1)
Support of the Kleene star operator seems to be broken. Consider the following syntax for parsing a sequence of a's:
>   context-free start-symbols
>     S
> 
>   context-free syntax
>     "a"  -> A
>     A* -> S

I specified another module containing the meaningless definition
>   context-free syntax
>     B* -> S

(no productions exist for B). If I now separately compile these two definitions and link them together, all sequences of a's but the singleton one are parsed ambiguously.


2)
Priorities do not work across module boundaries. For instance, consider a module syntax for unit and addition
>   context-free start-symbols
>     S
>   
>   context-free syntax
>     "u"   -> S {cons("Unit")}
>     S "+" S -> S {cons("Plus")}

and its extension by multiplication in another module
>   context-free syntax
>     S "*" S -> S {cons("Mul")}

Adding the following priority declaration to the syntax extension should do the trick of eliminating the ambiguity in the input string "u+u*u"
>   context-free priorities
>     S "*" S -> S {cons("Mul")}
>     >
>     S "+" S -> S {cons("Plus")}

With separate parse table compilation, however, the "Plus" production in the priority declaration is not identified with the "Plus" production of the base syntax definition. Therefore, two kinds of ambiguities arise for "u+u*u": First, the binding of the binary operators + and * remains ambiguous, and second there are two productions "S "+" S -> S {cons("Plus")}" available now, one from the base syntax and one from the priority declaration.


When extensively composing language definitions as we do in SugarJ, being able to separately compile grammars is essential. Without that feature the composition of grammars requires the recompilation of all involved syntax definitions, which is expansive when, for instance, extending Java. Support for separate parse table compilation would therefore be very much appreciated.

Best regards,
Sebastian

             21th International Symposium on
     Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                       LOPSTR 2011

           http://users.dsic.upv.es/~lopstr11/
          Odense, Denmark, July 18-20, 2011
                (co-located with PPDP 2011)

============================================================

Objectives:

The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR
is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any
language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 21st International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2011) will be held in Odense, Denmark; previous
symposia were held in Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice,
London, Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester,
Leuven, Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester (you
might have a look at the contents of past LOPSTR symposia). LOPSTR
2011 will be co-located with PPDP 2011 (International ACM SIGPLAN
Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).


Topics:

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development,
all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-
in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Papers describing
applications in these areas are especially welcome. Contributions are
welcome on all aspects of logic-based program development, including,
but not limited to:

- specification
- synthesis
- verification
- transformation
- analysis
- optimisation
- specialization
- partial evaluation
- inversion
- composition
- program/model manipulation
- certification
- security
- transformational techniques in SE
- applications and tools

Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application  papers, that describe experience with
industrial applications, are also welcome. Papers must describe
original work, be written and presented  in English, and must not
substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are
simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed
proceedings. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted.

Following past editions, the formal post-conference proceedings are
planned to be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science (LNCS) series.


IMPORTANT DATES AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:


- Paper submission: March 27,  2011
- Extended abstract submission: April 3, 2011
- Notification (for pre-proceedings): May 16, 2011
- Camera-ready (for pre-proceedings): June 12, 2011
- Symposium: July 18-20, 2011


Submissions can either be (short) extended abstracts or (full) papers
whose length should not exceed 9 and 15 pages (including references),
respectively. Submissions must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science style (excluding well-marked appendices not intended
for publication). Referees are not required to read the appendices,
and thus papers should be intelligible without them. Short papers may
describe work-in-progress or tool demonstrations.

Both short and full papers can be accepted for presentation at the
symposium and will then appear in the LOPSTR 2011
pre-proceedings. Full papers can also be immediately accepted for
publication in the formal proceedings, which is planned to be
published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series. In addition, after
the symposium, the programme committee will select further short or
full papers presented in LOPSTR 2011 to be considered for formal
publication. These authors will be invited to revise and/or extend
their submissions in the light of the feedback solicited at the
symposium. Then after another round of reviewing, these revised papers
can also be published in the formal proceedings.

#################################################################

Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is increasingly becoming a central
activity in the design of new systems and in the analysis of
existing systems because it enables designers and researchers to
investigate systems behavior through virtual representations. For
this reason, M&S is gaining a primary role in many industrial and
research fields, such as space, critical infrastructures,
manufacturing, emergency management, biomedical systems and
sustainable future. However, as the complexity of the
investigated systems increases and the types of investigations
widens, the cost of M&S activities increases for the more
complex models and for the communications among a wider number and
variety of M&S stakeholders (e.g., sub-domain experts, simulator
users, simulator engineers, and final system users). To address
the increasing costs of M&S activities, collaborative
technologies must be introduced to support these activities by
fostering the sharing and reuse of models, by facilitating the
communications among M&S stakeholders, and more generally by
integrating processes, tools and platforms.

Aside from seeking applications of collaborative technologies to
M&S activities, the track seeks innovative contributions that
deal with the application of M&S practices to the design of
collaborative environments. These environments are continuously
becoming more complex and therefore their design requires
systematic approaches to meet the required quality of
collaboration. This is important for two reasons: to reduce
rework activities on the actual collaborative environment, and to
maximize the productivity and the quality of the process the
collaborative environment supports. M&S offers the methodologies
and tools for such investigations and therefore it can be used to
improve the quality of collaborative environments.

A non?exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:

* collaborative environments for M&S
* collaborative Systems of Systems M&S
* workflow modelling for collaborative environments and processes
* agent-based M&S
* collaborative distributed simulation
* collaborative component-based M&S
* net-centric M&S
* web-based M&S
* model sharing and reuse
* model building and evaluation
* modeling and simulation of business processes
* modeling for collaboration
* simulation-based performance evaluation of collaborative networks
* model-driven simulation engineering
* domain specific languages for the simulation of collaborative environments
* domain specific languages for collaborative M&S
* databases and repositories for M&S
* distributed virtual environments
* virtual research environment for M&S

To stimulate creativity, however, the track maintains a wider
scope and invites interested researchers to present contributions
that offer original perspectives on collaboration and M&S.

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODEL TRANSFORMATION (ICMT) 2011

Co-located with TOOLS Europe 2011

Zurich - Switzerland, 27 - 28 June 2011

http://www.model-transformation.org/ICMT2011/
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Highlights
-------------------------
* ICMT is the premier forum for the presentation of contributions that
advance the state-of-the-art in the field of model transformation and aims
to bring together researchers from all areas of model transformation.

* Conference proceedings will be published in the Springer LNCS series

* A selection of the best papers from the conference will be published
in the Journal of Object Technology (JOT)

* Keynote speaker: Alexander Egyed

Overview
-------------------------

Modelling is a key element in reducing the complexity of software
systems during their development and maintenance. Model transformations
are essential for elevating models from documentation elements to
first-class artifacts of the development process. Model transformation
includes model-to-text transformation to generate code from models,
text-to-model transformations to parse textual representations to model
representations, model extraction to derive higher-level models from
legacy code, and model-to-model transformations to normalize, weave,
optimize, and refactor models, as well as to translate between modeling
languages.

Model transformation encompasses a variety of technical spaces,
including modelware, grammarware, and XML-ware, a variety of
transformation representations including graphs, trees, and DAGs, and a
variety of transformation paradigms including rule-based graph
transformation, term rewriting, and implementations in general-purpose
programming languages.

The study of model transformation includes foundations, semantics,
structuring mechanisms, and properties (such as modularity,
composability, and parameterization) of transformations, transformation
languages, techniques and tools. An important goal of the field is the
development of high-level declarative model transformation languages,
providing model representations of transformations that are amenable to
'higher-order' model transformation. To achieve impact on software
engineering practice, tools and methodologies to integrate model
transformation into existing development environments and processes are
required. ICMT is the premier forum for the presentation of
contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in the field of model
transformation and aims to bring together researchers from all areas of
model transformation.

Submission guidelines
-------------------------

All contributions will be subject to a rigorous selection process by the
international Program Committee, with an emphasis on originality,
practicality and overall quality. Papers should clearly indicate their
contributions with respect to previous work. Each paper will be reviewed
by at least 3 committee members. All submissions should follow the LNCS
format and should include the authors' names, affiliations and contact
details. Further instructions for submitting a paper will be available
at http://www.model-transformation.org/ICMT2011/.

As in previous editions of ICMT, we intend to publish proceedings in the
Springer LNCS series. Moreover, a special issue with a selection of the
best papers from the conference will be published in the Journal of
Object Technology (JOT).
