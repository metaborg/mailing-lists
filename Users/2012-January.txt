#################################################################

Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is increasingly becoming a central
activity in the design of new systems and in the analysis of
existing systems because it enables designers and researchers to
investigate systems behavior through virtual representations. For
this reason, M&S is gaining a primary role in many industrial and
research fields, such as space, critical infrastructures,
manufacturing, emergency management, biomedical systems and
sustainable future. However, as the complexity of the
investigated systems increases and the types of investigations
widens, the cost of M&S activities increases for the more
complex models and for the communications among a wider number and
variety of M&S stakeholders (e.g., sub-domain experts, simulator
users, simulator engineers, and final system users). To address
the increasing costs of M&S activities, collaborative
technologies must be introduced to support these activities by
fostering the sharing and reuse of models, by facilitating the
communications among M&S stakeholders, and more generally by
integrating processes, tools and platforms.

Aside from seeking applications of collaborative technologies to
M&S activities, the track seeks innovative contributions that
deal with the application of M&S practices to the design of
collaborative environments. These environments are continuously
becoming more complex, and therefore their design requires
systematic approaches to meet the required quality of
collaboration. This is important for two reasons: to reduce
rework activities on the actual collaborative environment, and to
maximize the productivity and the quality of the process the
collaborative environment supports. M&S offers the methodologies
and tools for such investigations and therefore it can be used to
improve the quality of collaborative environments.

A non?exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:

* collaborative environments for M&S
* collaborative Systems of Systems M&S
* workflow modelling for collaborative environments and processes
* agent-based M&S
* collaborative distributed simulation
* collaborative component-based M&S
* net-centric M&S
* web-based M&S
* model sharing and reuse
* model building and evaluation
* modeling and simulation of business processes
* modeling for collaboration
* simulation-based performance evaluation of collaborative networks
* model-driven simulation engineering
* domain specific languages for the simulation of collaborative environments
* domain specific languages for collaborative M&S
* databases and repositories for M&S
* distributed virtual environments
* virtual research environment for M&S
* collaborative DEVS M&S

To stimulate creativity, however, the track maintains a wider
scope and invites interested researchers to present contributions
that offer original perspectives on collaboration and M&S.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
On-Line Submissions and Publication
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CoMetS'12 intends to bring together researchers and practitioners
to discuss key issues, approaches, open problems, innovative
applications and trends in the track research area.

This year, we will accept submissions in two forms:

(1) papers
(2) poster and industrial presentations

(1) Papers should contain original contributions not published or
submitted elsewhere. Papers up to six pages (including figures,
tables and references) can be submitted. Papers should follow the
IEEE format, which is single spaced, two columns, 10 pt
Times/Roman font. All submissions should be electronic (in PDF)
and will be peer-reviewed by at least three program committee
members.

Accepted full papers will be included in the proceedings and
published by the IEEE Computer Society Press (IEEE approval pending).
Please note that at least one author for each accepted paper should
register to attend WETICE 2012 (http://www.wetice.org) to have the
paper published in the proceedings.

(2) Posters should describe a practical, on-the-field, experience in
any domain area using collaborative M&S. The poster submission
requires the submission of an abstract for evaluation from the
organizers. Accepted abstract must be followed by the submission of
a poster which will be displayed at conference time.
With the poster submission, a short (15 minutes) slot might be
allocated for oral presentation illustrating the industrial case.
The presentation may also include a live demo, but it should not
include commercial details.

Interested authors and participants may contact the organizers for
expression of interests and content appropriateness at any time.

Papers and posters can be submitted in PDF format at the submission
site (https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=comets2012),
which is supported by the EasyChair conference management system.
Please feel free to contact the track chairs (comets2012 at easychair.org)
if you experience problems with the EasyChair Web site.

Subject: [Stratego Users] parsing offside rule languages: alternative
	approach
Message-ID: <CA+zdwESbWv6k6+bmHy5Uw5PgE-GJYGdTTeW-h_2h4HHQ3fcyjg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I found a previous topic in this mailing list, about parsing offside rule
languages like Python in Spoofax. The suggestion was to follow the approach
of Ardlang: parse the indentation into the AST and do post-processing to
match e.g. "if" blocks with "else" blocks, and to find errors.

In the language I would like to parse the statements have a different
syntax depending on the type of block they are in. Those blocks can also be
nested. I would like to use the power of a declarative syntax definition to
define what is valid and what not, rather than parsing everything and do
extensive post-processing to find syntax errors.

I think I could do this by performing some limited pre-processing on the
input (basically placing "{" and "}" on the end of lines, based on
indentation). Among the automatically generated files in the project, I
found the java classes TestLanguageParseController.java and
TestLanguageParseControllerGenerated.java (in editor/java). In a first
attempt, I tried to override the parse method in
TestLanguageParseController.java, but this doesn't seem to do anything.

I'm wondering what you think about the pre-processing idea and where it can
be implemented in Spoofax. Also, I wonder whether this kind of
pre-processing (only altering line ends) would interfere with the
origin-tracking used to display error markers in the editor?

Kind regards,

Pieter-Jan Dewitte

Hi Pieter-Jan,

A preprocessor approach to support the offside rule is perhaps the most 
straightforward way of getting it working with SDF. But yes, 
unfortunately it interferes with the position information that is used 
in the parser and the editor. In the past there were many components 
that would analyze the parse tree and use the position information that 
can be inferred from there. And once one of these was off, all editor 
services from syntax highlighting to error marking would break...

It's been a while since we looked into this, but it might actually be a 
bit easier now, since we now have a new tokenizer infrastructure 
responsible for processing this information: the 
org.spoofax.jsglr.client.imploder.Tokenizer class is normally used to 
create tokens with position information, and forms the basis for syntax 
error marking, syntax highlighting, and IIRC the other services as well. 
So unless I'm missing something else, you could experiment with creating 
a subclass of the tokenizer that corrects for these special characters.

I think you were on the right path with the TestingParseController, 
which is used in the testing language to do a bit of post-processing and 
parser customization. But if you're making your own language, say, 
YourLang, you'd have to change your own parse controller: 
org.strategoxt.imp.editors.yourlang.YourLangParseController.java. From 
there, you should be able to preprocess the string, and set a different 
TreeBuilder with getWrapped().getParser().getParser().setTreeBuilder(). 
The TreeBuilder is responsible for creating and using a Tokenizer.

hth,

Lennart Kats

Hello,

I recently tried to download Aterm and noticed that I don't know the
username/password to access the FTP site:
ftp://ftp.stratego-language.org/pub/stratego/StrategoXT/strategoxt-0.17/aterm-2.5.tar.gz

Is it possible to get access?

Thank you!

Something changed on the server to make it stop working. I ave fixed it,
and you should be able to download everything again.

Any reason we use FTP? I know it's oldskool that's supposedly cool,
but an HTTP mirror would be more convenient for all, I suspect.

Thank you, I was able to download ATerm today.
