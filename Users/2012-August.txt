Subject: [Stratego Users] Concrete syntax Hello World
Message-ID: <CAJ8oX-F6aNHEHxO7t1zOdgHx-g=sJVXJyM0zcf2uAxSrKG6dPQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am very new to Spoofax. I'm having difficulty using concrete syntax to
write rules. I've tried following the instructions I've found online on the
hello world example formed at startup. This hasn't worked for me so far. I
do the following:

Fire up Eclipse.
File : New Project : Spoofax Project - Name it test

Build it, confirm that it runs.

Inside test.str I create a small rule using concrete syntax
  rl1:
   |[entity x{y : String}]| -> |[entity x{y : Int}]|

build and receive the following error (this is expected)
Syntax error, not expected here: |[

I then try to follow the instructions here
http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/55

I add the files
syntax/Stratego-Test.sdf
trans/test.meta

I add the following text into trans/test.meta
Meta([Syntax("Stratego-Test")])

I add the following lines to build.main.xml under build.stratego.arms just
under --library
         -I &quot;${include}&quot;
         -I &quot;${lib}&quot;

I build and receive the following error
cannot find the parse table for syntax "Stratego-Test" in the include path

I assume I need to fill Stratego-Test with my syntax (is copying ok or
should I have renamed my file Test.sdf to Stratego-Test.sdf?
I build and this error goes away but I continue to receive the error
Syntax error, not expected here: |[

There are other instructions on the mailing list about adding meta-syntax
to the main target in build.main.xml . This causes more errors. What am I
missing?

I have a set of rewrite rules that are not confluent. I.e. depending on the
order I can obtain many equally valid results. I would like to see all
possible outcomes (my rules do terminate). Is there a standard way to do
this using Stratego?

I'm looking for the equivalent of the `search` command in Maude.

There is not an out-of-the-box method to do that. You'd need to define
your own strategy. A basic building block in such a strategy could be
the following combinators:

  alt(r) = ![<r>] <+ ![]
  alt(r, s) = ![<r> | <s>] <+ s

which you can use to retrieve all possible one-step rewrites from a
set of rewrite rules r1, ..., rn:

  one-step = alt(r1, alt(r2, ... alt(rn) ... ))

You can combine that with some traversal strategy. For example,

  alt-td(r) = ![<r>] <+ ![]
  alt-td(r, s) = ![<oncetd(r)> | <s>] <+ s

would not just apply a rule at the top, but find a redex anywhere in the term.

  one-step-td = alt-td(r1, alt(r2, ... alt(rn) ... ))

To repeatedly apply rules, you'd do something like:

  all-rewrites0 = ![<id>]; repeat(mapconcat(one-step-td))

That is, repeatedly apply one-step-td to the terms in a list and
concatenate the resulting lists.

Unfortunately, this will eventually return the empty list, since if
<one-step-td> t returns [], the term t is in normal form. So you need
to collect normal forms along the way.

  one-step-td-nf :
     t -> (nfs, ts)
     where ts := <one-step-td> t;
              nfs := <if ?[] then [t] else []> ts

  one-step-list :
    (nfs1, ts1@[_|_]) -> (<concat>(nfs1,nfs2), ts')
    where (nfs2, ts2) := <map(one-step-nf); unzip; (concat, concat)> ts1

  all-rewrites1 :
    t -> nfs
    where (nfs, []) := <repeat(one-step-list)> ([], [t])

This should give you all the normal forms for a set of rewrite rules.
You may want to experiment with alternative strategies if you also
want all intermediate terms. In addition, you may want to look into
the traversal strategy used; oncetd will deterministically find the
topmost-leftmost redex, hiding other redexes. Depending on your rules,
you may need a strategy that produces all possible rewrites for a
single rule as well.

Disclaimer: I did not test any of the code above; consider it an email sketch.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Ambiguities in Reserving Keywords
Message-ID: <CALSaTaj=cYTi5Lya0ewidT=EOYy-SYACCjECQpOFp+wDJv+=zw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I got some ambiguities in my grammar when I use keywords. I have the
following type definition:

BasicType		-> Type {cons("basicType")}
TypeName		-> Type {cons("typeName")}
"int"			-> BasicType {cons("basicTypeInt")}
"nat"			-> BasicType {cons("basicTypeNat")}
?
Name			-> TypeName {cons("typeNameDef")}
ID 	 		-> Name {cons("name")}
?

In the lexical part I defined a list of reject keywords:
"int"			-> Keyword
"nat"			-> Keyword
Keyword		-> ID {reject}

And also some lexical restrictions:
  lexical restrictions
    "nat" "int" -/- [A-Za-z0-9\_]	

But my grammar still with ambiguities and I don?t know if I?m missing
something or there is another way to prioritize the keywords.  Any
idea?

Regards,
Cristiano

Hi Cristiano,

I can't spot an ambiguity in this fragment. Perhaps it is somewhere
else? It would be useful to see an example of an ambiguity, i.e. the
string that caused it and the ATerm produced by the parser.

Hi Eelco,
Consider the follow example:

 types
    public Byte = nat

The problem is that "nat" is not recognized as a keyword and then it
can be a basic type or a name type. I expected that "nat" is a basic
type only because is a keyword, which was defined in the lexical part.
The generated ATerm for this small example is:

programParagraph(
  globalDeclaration(
    typeDeclaration(
      types(
        amb(
          [ typeDef1(Some(qualifierPublic()), "Byte",
basicType(basicTypeNat()), None())
          , typeDef1(
              Some(qualifierPublic())
            , "Byte"
            , typeName(typeNameDef(name("at", None())))
            , None()
            )
          ]
        )
      , []
      )
    )
  )
, []
)


I guess I'm doing something wrong when I define the keywords.
Thanks in advanced,
Regards,
Cristiano

Hi Cristiano,

when I had a look at your example ATerm I noticed that in the second 
case of the ambiguity the "n" of "nat" was not part of name(...).

I would guess, that the rule which produces the ATerm types(...) is a 
context-free rule R. As a consequence of this there are automatically 
inserted <LAYOUT?-CF> between all terms in the body of R. Perhaps you 
have defined n instead of \n as a LAYOUT character. This would explain 
the ambiguity: in the first case "n" is part of "nat" and in the second 
case it is recognized as LAYOUT.

Regards
Daniel

I'm trying to get concrete object syntax to work in a small project. I've
compiled all of the changes I've made into a commit and posted it to
Github.

https://github.com/mrocklin/mx/commit/dcb69ac517c88a8cfc106d440207b3b1060675e8

I'm getting an error in
simplify.str<https://github.com/mrocklin/mx/blob/dcb69ac517c88a8cfc106d440207b3b1060675e8/trans/simplify.str>that
it doesn't like the line `include/mx` in the imports. It seems to not
like anything that comes after a slash in this file. I've also lost syntax
highlighting in this file. Perhaps by adding my syntax file I've removed
the standard one?

My hope is that because all of the changes are clearly shown in the above
commit it will be easy to locate the error.

Thank you for your time,
-Matthew

Hi Daniel,
You are right, the problem was with the layout character. It works now :-)
Thanks a lot.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Broken SVN link for Tiger language repository
Message-ID: <CAJ8oX-E953XsfYRtqj7TsvRd_D0vc451kT2TDDe1HmYBJebMQA@mail.gmail.com>

I wanted to see some example code for a working Stratego/XT project. I
decided to checkout the svn repository for the Tiger language. You have
some links listed here
http://strategoxt.org/Tiger/DownloadAndInstallation

These links appear to be broken. Is this repository still available
someplace else?

Have a look at these:

  https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/tiger/
  https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/tiger-spoofax/

In general, we tend to collect most Spoofax/Stratego related work in
this big repository:

  https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT

Feel free to browse around. But note that the tools are under
development and that not all example projects work with the latest
version of Spoofax.

Hi Matthew,

The (or at least one) problem is that your Stratego-mx.sdf does not
actually import the Stratego syntax definition and inject your
expression syntax as Term's into the Stratego grammar.

I haven't had time yet to fix example so that it does.

cheers,

This is a case of a novice (me) attempting to follow instructions without
understanding what is going on. The solutions that I see to this problem
are the following

1) More explicit step-by-step instructions than what exist in issue 55 or
the associated e-mail thread. (perhaps an example project?)
2) I learn more about what is really happening. Can you point me to
specific documentation that would give me sufficient understanding so that
I can solve this problem on my own? I'm going through your manual and
tutorial. Are there specific sections that I could read that would provide
sufficient information to solve this problem?

I'll look again at the documentation and see if I can get this to work. If
I can I'll put up an example repo on github that can hopefully serve as a
clear example for the future.

Yes. And we need better integration in Spoofax.

The GPCE 2002 paper (Meta-Programming with Concrete Object Syntax)
explains the idea.

Yes, your expression example should be useful.

I took a look at this and now I have a better idea of what is going on.
Thanks for the link. I'm still not able to structure my project in such a
way that the relevant str file parses. My Stratego-mx.sdf file now looks
like this
https://github.com/mrocklin/mx/blob/concrete-object-syntax/syntax/Stratego-mx.sdf

Which I think is the minimal example in my case.

I still get basic parsing errors with simplify.str though. It still doesn't
appear to recognize Stratego syntax. Is there a simple working example
somewhere to which I could refer?

In my ideal world I could look at a simple and intuitive example like
calculang<https://github.com/mrocklin/mx/blob/concrete-object-syntax/syntax/Stratego-mx.sdf>
and
see how this feature is properly used.

Hi Matthew,

> Is there a simple working example somewhere to which I could refer?

WebDSL uses concrete object syntax (but it is not simple). The syntax
definition is here:

   https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/WebDSL/webdsls/trunk/src/org/webdsl/dsl/syntax/

A good starting point is

   https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/WebDSL/webdsls/trunk/src/org/webdsl/dsl/syntax/StrategoWebDSL.sdf

And some Stratego files that use the syntax:

   https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/WebDSL/webdsls/trunk/src/org/webdsl/dsl/to-java-servlet/data-validation/
