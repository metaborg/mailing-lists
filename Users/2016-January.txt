# SPLASH'16 Call for Workshop Proposals

Following its long-standing tradition, SPLASH 2016 will host a variety of
high-quality workshops, allowing their participants to meet and discuss
research questions with peers, to mature new and exciting ideas, and to
build up communities and start new collaborations. SPLASH workshops
complement the main tracks of the conference and provide meetings in a
smaller and more specialized setting. Workshops cultivate new ideas and
concepts for the future, optionally recorded in formal proceedings.

# SUBMISSION SUMMARY

Early Submissions Due: January 15, 2016
Notification: February 12, 2016
Late Submissions Due: March 4, 2016
Notification: April 1, 2016
Format: ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings format
Submit to: https://splash16workshops.hotcrp.com/
Chairs: Jan Rellermeyer and Craig Anslow
Contact: workshops at splashcon.org

** Please note the earlier submission deadline than in previous years. **

### TOPICS

We encourage proposals for workshops on any topic relevant to SPLASH. If
there is a topic relevant to SPLASH that you feel passionate about, and you
want to connect with others who have similar interests, you should consider
submitting a proposal to organize a workshop! The exact format of the
workshop can be defined by the proposal submitters, and we more than
welcome new, and unconventional ideas for workshop formats. The following
suggestions may serve as a starting point:

Mini-conferences provide their participants the possibility to present
their work to other domain experts. The smaller and more specialized
setting of the workshop allows for more extensive Q&A sessions and
facilitates ample discussions, which may continue after the workshop.
Typically, presentations of work-in-progress as well as of completed
projects are welcome. The workshop may or may not produce formal
proceedings.

Retreats act as a platform for domain experts to gather with the purpose of
tackling the issues of a predetermined research agenda. Retreats are highly
interactive and goal-oriented, allowing their participants to address open
challenges in their domain, to explore new, uncharted ideas, and to (maybe
even) uncover new, promising research domains.

Agenda-setting workshops provide a forum for domain experts to determine a
research agenda for a sub-field, and may include collaborations on an
agenda document that is published after the workshop is over.

Other common activities at workshops include poster sessions, hands-on
practical work, and focus groups. Proposal submitters should feel free to
direct questions about workshop formats to the workshop chairs. Workshops
that include presentation of research papers, and that implement a
SIGPLAN-approved selection process, may be archived as formal proceedings
in the ACM Digital Library; note that this option is available only to
submitters to the early phase.

# WORKSHOP SELECTION

### Reviewing Phases

This year, SPLASH provides two submission phases to accommodate different
schedules, a early round in January and a late round of proposals in March.
Since space is limited at the venue, the PC will consider prospective
attendance as one of the selection criteria.

### Proposal Content

SPLASH workshop proposals should not exceed 6 pages, and must include the
following information:

Title and desired abbreviation: if the workshop is accepted, this will be
used for advertising purposes.

Theme, goals and format: the main topic and goals of the workshop, the
workshop's relevance to the SPLASH community, as well as the workshop's
format (e.g., mini-conference, retreat, agenda-setting workshop).

Abstract: a 150-word abstract that summarizes the theme and goals of the
workshop. If the workshop is accepted, this abstract will be used for
advertising purposes.

Organizers: workshop organizers are responsible for advertising the
workshop (e.g., creating the anchoring website for the workshop and sending
CFPs to relevant mailing lists), organizing the reviewing process (e.g., by
forming a small program committee), running the workshop, and collating any
results of the workshop for dissemination. The proposal should indicate the
names, affiliations, and contact details of the workshop organizers as well
as a primary organizer and contact person (primary organizer and contact
person do not need to be the same). For each organizer, the proposal should
describe his/her background (expertise in the area and previous experience
in running workshops) and also identify his/her responsibilities for the
workshop.

Anticipated attendance: the ideal, minimum, and maximum expected number of
participants. Please note that there will be an additional charge for
workshop registration at SPLASH 2015. The SPLASH organizing committee
reserves the right to cancel any workshops that do not meet attendance
goals.

Advertisement: the planned advertisement for the workshop to ensure
sufficient participation.

Participant preparation: what preparation is expected from workshop
participants, including how attendees gain access to the workshop (e.g.,
submission of a full paper, an extended abstract, a position paper).

Activities and format: the format of the workshop and a timetable. All
SPLASH 2015 workshops must be planned for one or two full days of
activities. For example, the proposal should describe whether there will be
introductory material, paper presentations, panel discussions, debates,
hands-on sessions, or focus groups, and how such groups will report back to
the other participants.

Post-workshop activities: what results are expected, and how these will be
disseminated to the wider public after the workshop. Workshops that result
in peer-reviewed papers and implement an ACM SIGPLAN-approved selection
process can submit formal proceedings to the ACM Digital Library. To get
the approval, the workshop has to meet the usual requirements defined for
ACM SIGPLAN events (i.e., approval of workshop proposal and workshop
program committee by ACM SIGPLAN). The approval process is coordinated by
the SPLASH organizers.

Special requirements: any special requirements you might have, in terms of
room configuration, audio and video equipment, etc.

### Format

Submissions should use the SIGPLAN Proceedings Format, 10 point font. Note
that by default the SIGPLAN Proceedings Format produces papers in 9 point
font. If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to set
the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your
paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that
supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission.

### Publication

If your workshop chooses to have published proceedings, be aware that
accepted papers will be available in the ACM Digital Library as early as
September 23, 2016. The official publication date is the date the
proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. The official
publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to
published work. It is therefore vital that this information will be
communicated to participants in your workshop.

### Evaluation criteria

Workshop proposals will be selected based on the quality of the proposal
and according to the space available at SPLASH. The following questions may
be helpful in devising a high-quality proposal:

Are there at least two organizers and do they represent a reasonably varied
cross-section of the community close to the topic?

Does the abstract present a compelling case for the importance of the topic
area?

Are the goals of the workshop expressed clearly?

Is the topic likely to be attractive to SPLASH attendees?

Does the chosen format encourage a high level of interaction between the
participants?

Is a workshop the right forum to address the theme and goals or does the
proposal fit better into another type of SPLASH event?

#################################################################

Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is increasingly becoming a central
activity in the design of new systems and in the analysis of
existing systems because it enables designers and researchers to
investigate systems behavior through virtual representations. For
this reason, M&S is gaining a primary role in many industrial and
research fields, such as space, critical infrastructures,
manufacturing, emergency management, biomedical systems and
sustainable future. However, as the complexity of the
investigated systems increases and the types of investigations
widens, the cost of M&S activities increases for the more
complex models and for the communications among a wider number and
variety of M&S stakeholders (e.g., sub-domain experts, simulator
users, simulator engineers, and final system users). To address
the increasing costs of M&S activities, collaborative
technologies must be introduced to support these activities by
fostering the sharing and reuse of models, by facilitating the
communications among M&S stakeholders, and more generally by
integrating processes, tools and platforms.

Aside from seeking applications of collaborative technologies to
M&S activities, the track seeks innovative contributions that
deal with the application of M&S practices in the field of
collaborative engineering platforms. These platforms are continuously
becoming more complex, and therefore their design requires
systematic approaches to meet the required quality of
collaboration. This is important for two reasons: to reduce
rework activities on the actual collaborative environment, and to
maximize the productivity and the quality of the process the
collaborative environment supports. M&S offers the methodologies
and tools for such investigations and therefore it can be used to
improve the quality of collaborative environments.

A non-exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:

* collaborative requirements modeling
* collaborative environments for M&S
* collaborative Systems of Systems M&S
* business process modeling for collaborative environments
* agent-based M&S
* collaborative distributed simulation
* collaborative component-based M&S
* net-centric M&S
* web-based M&S
* model sharing and reuse
* model building and evaluation
* modeling and simulation of business processes
* modeling for collaboration
* simulation-based performance analysis of collaborative engineering
platforms
* model-driven approaches for collaborative engineering
* domain specific languages for collaborative M&S
* databases and repositories for M&S
* distributed virtual environments
* virtual research environment for M&S
* collaborative DEVS M&S
* multi-method M&S

To stimulate creativity, however, the track maintains a wider
scope and invites interested researchers to present contributions
that offer original perspectives on collaboration and M&S.

PROHA 2016, CALL FOR PAPERS

First Workshop on
Program Transformation for Programmability in Heterogeneous Architectures

http://goo.gl/RzGbzY

Barcelona, 12th March 2016, in conjunction with the CGO'16 Conference

*********************************************************************************

Important Dates:

Paper submission deadline: 15 January 2016 23:59 (UTC)
Author notification: 5 February 2016
Final manuscript due: 26 February 2016


Scope:

Developing and maintaining high-performance applications and libraries
for heterogeneous architectures is a difficult task, usually requiring
code transformations performed by an expert.

Tools assisting in and, if possible, automating such transformations
are of course of great interest. However, such tools require
significant knowledge and reasoning capabilities. For example, the
former could be a machine-understandable descriptions of what a piece
of code is expected to do, while the latter could be a set of
transformations and a corresponding logical context in which they are
applicable, respectively. Furthermore, strategies to identify the
sequence of transformations leading to the best resulting code need to
be elaborated.

This workshop will focus on techniques and foundations which make it
possible to perform source code transformations, which preserve the
intended semantics of the original code and improve efficiency,
portability or maintainability.

The topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

* Program annotations to capture algorithmic properties and intended
  code semantics.

* Programming paradigms able to express underlying (mathematical)
  properties of code.

* Usage of dynamic and static mechanisms to infer relevant code
  properties.

* Transformations which preserve intended semantics.

* Strategies to apply transformations.

* Heuristics to guide program transformation and techniques to
  synthesize / learn these heuristics.

* Tools


Submission Guidelines:

Submissions are to be written in English and not exceed 10 pages,
including bibliography.  Submissions should be written in ACM
double-column format using a 10-point type.  Authors should follow the
information for formatting ACM SIGPLAN conference papers, which can be
found at http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author .

Authors should submit their papers in pdf format using the EasyChair
submission website https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=proha2016 .

# SPLASH 2016

The ACM SIGPLAN conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and
Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of
software construction, to make it the premier conference at the
intersection of programming, languages, systems, and software engineering.
We invite high quality submissions describing original and unpublished work.


## OOPSLA Research Papers

Papers that address any aspect of software development are welcome,
including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation,
generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance,
reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems. Papers may address
these topics in a variety of ways, including new tools (such as languages,
program analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as
methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and
management techniques), and new evaluations (such as formalisms and proofs,
corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).

Submissions due: Wed 23 March, 2016
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/splash-2016-oopsla


## Onward! Research Papers

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to
do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages,
communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and
more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet
proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and
reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

Submissions due: Fri 1 April, 2016
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/onward2016/onward-2016-papers


## Onward! Essays

Onward! Essays is looking for clear and compelling pieces of writing about
topics important to the software community. An essay can be an exploration
of a topic, its impact, or the circumstances of its creation; it can
present a personal view of what is, explore a terrain, or lead the reader
in an act of discovery; it can be a philosophical digression or a deep
analysis. It can describe a personal journey, perhaps by which the author
reached an understanding of such a topic. The subject area should be
interpreted broadly and can include the relationship of software to human
endeavors, or its philosophical, sociological, psychological, historical,
or anthropological underpinnings.

Submissions due: Fri 1 April, 2016
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/onward2016/onward2016-essays

## Workshops

The SPLASH Workshops track will host a variety of high-quality workshops,
allowing their participants to meet and discuss research questions with
peers, to mature new and exciting ideas, and to build up communities and
start new collaborations. SPLASH workshops complement the main tracks of
the conference and provide meetings in a smaller and more specialized
setting. Workshops cultivate new ideas and concepts for the future,
optionally recorded in formal proceedings.

Late Phase Submissions of Workshop Proposals due: Fri 4 Mar, 2016
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/splash2016-workshops


## Doctoral Symposium

The SPLASH Doctoral Symposium provides students with useful guidance for
completing their dissertation research and beginning their research
careers. The Symposium will provide an interactive forum for doctoral
students who have progressed far enough in their research to have a
structured proposal, but will not be defending their dissertation in the
next 12 months.

Submissions due: Thu 30 Jun, 2016
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/splash-2016-ds


## Posters

The SPLASH Poster track provides an excellent forum for authors to present
their recent or ongoing projects in an interactive setting, and receive
feedback from the community. We invite submissions covering any aspect of
programming, systems, languages and applications. The goal of the poster
session is to encourage and facilitate small groups of individuals
interested in a technical area to gather and interact.

Poster submissions due: Fri 8 Jul, 2016
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/splash-2016-posters

## Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS)

DLS is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to share
knowledge and research on dynamic languages, their implementation, and
applications. The influence of dynamic languages ? from Lisp to Smalltalk
to Python to Javascript ? on real-world practice, and research, continues
to grow. We invite high quality papers reporting original research,
innovative contributions, or experience related to dynamic languages, their
implementation, and applications.

Submissions due: Fri 10 June, 2016
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/dls-2016/dls-2016-papers


## Software Language Engineering (SLE)

Software Language Engineering (SLE) is the application of systematic,
disciplined, and measurable approaches to the development, use, deployment,
and maintenance of software languages. The term ?software language? is used
broadly, and includes: general-purpose programming languages;
domain-specific languages (e.g. BPMN, Simulink, Modelica); modeling and
metamodeling languages (e.g. SysML and UML); data models and ontologies
(e.g. XML-based and OWL-based languages and vocabularies). SLE solicits
high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and conceptual
contributions to tools, techniques, and frameworks in the domain of
language engineering.

Submissions due: Fri 17 June, 2016 (abstracts); Fri 24 June, 2016 (papers)
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/sle-2016/sle-2016-papers

## Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE)

The International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts &
Experiences (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested
in techniques that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and
component deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software
quality, and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition
to exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to
foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the
programming languages research communities.

Submissions due: Fri 17 June, 2016 (abstracts); Fri 24 June, 2016 (papers)
