 CALL FOR PAPERS

                 4th International Workshop on
        Model-driven Approaches for Simulation Engineering
    part of the Symposium on Theory of Modeling and Simulation
                     (SCS SpringSim 2014)


#################################################################

April 13-16, 2014, Tampa, FL (USA)
http://www.sel.uniroma2.it/Mod4Sim14

#################################################################
# Papers Due: *** November 1, 2013 ***
# Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
# and archived in the ACM Digital Library.
#################################################################

The workshop aims to bring together experts in model-based, model-driven
and software engineering with experts in simulation methods and simulation
practitioners, with the objective to advance the state of the art in
model-driven simulation engineering.

Model-driven engineering approaches provide considerable advantages to
software systems engineering activities through the provision of consistent
and coherent models at different abstraction levels. As these models are in
a machine readable form, model-driven engineering approaches can also
support the exploitation of computing capabilities for model reuse,
programming code generation, and model checking, for example.

The definition of a simulation model, its software implementation and its
execution platform form what is known as simulation engineering. As
simulation systems are mainly based on software, these systems can
similarly benefit from model-driven approaches to support automatic
software generation, enhance software quality, and reduce costs,
development effort and time-to-market.

Similarly to systems and software engineering, simulation engineering can
exploit the capabilities of model-driven approaches by increasing the
abstraction level in simulation model specifications and by automating the
derivation of simulator code. Further advantages can be gained by using
modeling languages, such as UML and SysML ? but not exclusively those. For
example, modeling languages can be used for descriptive modeling (to
describe the system to be simulated), for analytical modeling (to specify
analytically the simulation of the same system), and for implementation
modeling (to define the respective simulator).

A partial list of topics of interest includes:

* model-driven simulation engineering processes
* requirements modeling for simulation
* domain specific languages for modeling and simulation
* model transformations for simulation model building
* model transformations for simulation model implementation
* model-driven engineering of distributed simulation systems
* relationship between metamodeling standards (e.g., MOF, Ecore) and
distributed simulation standards (e.g., HLA, DIS)
* metamodels for simulation reuse and interoperability
* model-driven technologies for different simulation paradigms (discrete
event simulation, multi-agent simulation, sketch-based * simulation, etc.)
* model-driven methods and tools for performance engineering of simulation
systems
* simulation tools for model-driven software performance engineering
* model-driven technologies for simulation verification and validation
* model-driven technologies for data collection and analysis
* model-driven technologies for simulation visualization
* Executable UML
* Executable Architectures
* SysML / Modelica integration
* Simulation Model Portability and reuse
* model-based systems verification and validation
* simulation for model-based systems engineering

To stimulate creativity, however, the workshop maintains a wider scope and
welcomes contributions offering original perspectives on model-driven
engineering of simulation systems.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Where to download Stratego/XT packages?
Message-ID: <CAO51=GT9qxNPX=7+hhmcguTySGSumGutvOQyK8GmgbiDWTD+TA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I found the ftp site for downloading stratego packages are not available
now. Is there any other places I can download those packages?

It would also be greatly appreciated if anyone send me those packages
through email. I would need those "One-click installation using Nix",
better also with source code packages.

Thanks!

Subject: [Stratego Users] thread-oncebu
Message-ID: <52412290.7060507@gmail.com>

Can someone suggest a clean way to construct a thread-oncebu strategy?  
My attempts aren't working.  thread-replacement works as a threaded 
version of all(s), but what would the equivalent be for a threaded 
version of the strategy one(s)?

Thanks,
Brandon

Hi Brandon,

we are not quite sure what you try to achieve, but we figured something out for the case that you want a oncebu(s) which additionally updates extra data at the point where it applies s.

The solution assumes the following:
	t is the term to traverse,
	t' is the rewritten term,
	d is the original data,
        d' is the updated data,
	s is the local strategy to apply (working on a pair (t, d) and returning a pair (t', d').
You can then call <oncebu(<s> (<id>, d); ?(<id>, d'))> t => t'

Does this help or do you have something different in mind?

This does help.  Thank you.  Essentially, my system generates a list of IR
trees.  During an unoptimized compilation, I convert each of these trees
into a list of machine instructions using <thread-bottomup(node-to-instr)>
(trees, (bus1_instr, bus2_instr)).  bus1_instr and bus2_instr are the
resulting lists of instructions.  During an optimized compilation the
instructions of all the trees get interwoven to fill bubbles in the
pipeline.  Not all trees are the same size, so I have put my IR trees in
order of processing priority.  I need to repeatedly grab the first IR node
that is ready (and thus highest priority), and translate that into the
instructions for each bus and replace that IR node with the appropriate
result register in the tree.  Thus, I will end up putting this oncebu call
into a repeat-until strategy that will keep rewriting the highest priority
node until all the trees are consumed.  It may not be efficient but the
trees are small.  Now I can focus on how to wrap this up as a fixed point
strategy in the repeat-until style.  I think I see what I need to do.

Hi Brandon,

We once made an attempt at supporting instruction selection:

     http://researchr.org/publication/BravenboerV02

Unfortunately the ++ operator used in that paper was an experimental
feature that has been dropped since. But perhaps the paper provides some
inspiration nonetheless.

I'd be interested in seeing the solution that you come up with.

cheers,

-- Eelco
