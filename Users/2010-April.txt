SCOPE
***************

The increased complexity of Web sites and the explosive growth of
Web-based applications has turned their design and construction into
a challenging problem. Nowadays, many companies have diverted their
Web sites into interactive, completely-automated, Web-based
applications (such as Amazon, on-line banking, or travel agencies)
with a high complexity that requires appropriate specification and
verification techniques and tools. Systematic, formal approaches to
the analysis and verification can address the problems of this
particular domain with automated and reliable tools that also
incorporate semantic aspects.

We solicit original papers on formal methods and techniques applied
to Web sites, Web services or Web-based applications, such as:

* rule-based approaches to Web system analysis,
   certification, specification, verification,
   and optimization
* algebraic methods for verification and certification
   of Web systems
* formal models for describing and reasoning about Web sites
* model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web sites
* analysis and verification of linked data
* abstract interpretation and program transformation
   applied to the semantic Web
* intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for
   Web specifications authoring
* Web quality and Web metrics
* Web usability and accessibility
* Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications

The WWV series provides a forum for researchers from the communities
of Rule-based programming, Automated Software Engineering, and
Web-oriented research to facilitate the cross-fertilization and the
advancement of hybrid methods that combine the three areas.

The previous WWV editions were: WWV'09 (Hagenberg, Austria),
WWV'08 (Siena, Italy), WWV'07 (Venice, Italy), WWV'06 (Paphos, Cyprus),
and WWV'05 (Valencia, Spain).

Hi everyone,
I`m developing a DSL that extends Haskell, I`ve implemented the SDF. But
know I need to implement the transformation, I searched  on the Stratego/XT
Website and found a framework called HSX to transformations, but the link is
always unavailable. Does anyone could help me, providing me the file?
The content I`d like to access is this :
http://www.stratego-language.org/ftp/hsx-0.1.tar.gz , available on this
page: http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/HSX

Many thanks,

Marcos Augusto

Hi Marcos,

The source is available in the StrategoXT svn repository

   https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/hsx/trunk/

I've updated the webpage.

However, I doubt that this will be useful for you. The code is for
Stratego 0.3 (we're now at 0.18)
and probably uses antiquated stratego programming styles.

cheers,

Ok, thanks. I`ll try it.
Does anybody have any documentation that shows how to install/use this
framework?


Thank,

Hi Marcos,

It can hardly be called a framework. The code was the basis for this
publication:

  http://researchr.org/publication/JohannV00

which describes the implementation of the warm fusion transformation
in Stratego.

I don't think there is any documentation for installation. And it is
not unlikely that
the code will not compile with the current version of Stratego; for
starters the file
extension has been changed from .r to .str.

cheers,

-- Eelco

Subject: [Stratego Users] Comments in parse tree
Message-ID: <u2w5d2ff4fc1004220023ia09e40c4jb05d8faf595610ba@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am writing a C grammar in SDF. And I would like to have the comments
in the parse tree, so that I can pretty print them to the result C
file (after I perform some transformations). I need the comments,
because these might carry some useful meta-information (behavior
protocols, etc.).
The problem is, that the comments can be written almost everywhere
(inside expressions, in parameter lists, between type and var name in
declarations, etc.).

Is there an easy way to get the whole parse tree before the LAYOUT is left out?
Or do I need to insert the MultiLineComment symbol in between each of
the symbols in all the context-free rules in my grammar? (I hope not).
Or is there another way to handle this problem?


Thanks for your reply,
greetings,

Lukas


P.S. By 'comments' I refer to the MultiLineComments (/* text */). I
transform the single-line comments to the multi-line ones before the C
language parser gets the file.

Hi Lukas,

Try the following options of sglri:

   Preserving options:
   --preserve-comments
                    Preserve source code comments as annotations of
the abstract
                    syntax tree. [off]
   --preserve-positions
                    Preserve source code positions in the input file
as annotations
                    of the abstract syntax tree. [off]
   --preserve-locations
                    Preserve source code locations in the input file
as annotations
                    of the abstract syntax tree. [off]

(see sglri --help)
