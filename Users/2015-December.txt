FYI. Might just invite him to visit me in Den Haag then.

Currently we are running everything as external tools. This works, but is rather clumsy (and probably not something we want our users to do). But maybe I should come over for this another time, when Peter is in Delft as well and the code generator has stabilised.

*********************************************************************************

PROHA 2016, CALL FOR PAPERS

First Workshop on
Program Transformation for Programmability in Heterogeneous Architectures

http://goo.gl/RzGbzY

Barcelona, 12th March 2016, in conjunction with the CGO'16 Conference

*********************************************************************************

Important Dates:

Paper submission deadline: 15 January 2016 23:59 (UTC)
Author notification: 5 February 2016
Final manuscript due: 26 February 2016


Scope:

Developing and maintaining high-performance applications and libraries
for heterogeneous architectures is a difficult task, usually requiring
code transformations performed by an expert.

Tools assisting in and, if possible, automating such transformations
are of course of great interest. However, such tools require
significant knowledge and reasoning capabilities. For example, the
former could be a machine-understandable descriptions of what a piece
of code is expected to do, while the latter could be a set of
transformations and a corresponding logical context in which they are
applicable, respectively. Furthermore, strategies to identify the
sequence of transformations leading to the best resulting code need to
be elaborated.

This workshop will focus on techniques and foundations which make it
possible to perform source code transformations, which preserve the
intended semantics of the original code and improve efficiency,
portability or maintainability.

The topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

* Program annotations to capture algorithmic properties and intended
  code semantics.

* Programming paradigms able to express underlying (mathematical)
  properties of code.

* Usage of dynamic and static mechanisms to infer relevant code
  properties.

* Transformations which preserve intended semantics.

* Strategies to apply transformations.

* Heuristics to guide program transformation and techniques to
  synthesize / learn these heuristics.

* Tools
