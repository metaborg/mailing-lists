Hi,

Just pick the "aterm-2.5 + sdf2-bundle-2.4 + strategoxt-0.17" package from the download page below, extract it with something like 7-zip, and read the README for further instructions.

Alternatively, you can also try the Spoofax Eclipse plugin at http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax, which includes a Java-based distribution of Stratego. It allows you to build your own language and transformations together with IDE support.

Hi Gouasmi,

What exactly are you trying to do?

And for the Spoofax plugin you don't need the aterm/sdf/strategoxt packages, it's all included. Just try it and follow the tour on spoofax.org.

Hi Mr,

I have to generate a tool which makes the transformation(processing) automatic between two specifications of two different languages. The specification of input is written in latex (commands and operators in latex) and the second? specification to be generate in latex also.
I do not know if this generation is feasible by your tool? If yes, how I have to make exactly, because I did not understand how to use Stratego / XT, and which is the link between Stratego / XT and Spoofax?? 
please help me in the proche time possible
execuse me for the distrubance

Message-ID: <16633a591003220813k7e55be4dtc5cf77f1c7e5da9b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have just started with Stratego/XT and am trying to setup a little
project for translating a language into another.
I guess I'll be bothering you guys with many questions, and will start
today with the following.

Say I have defined SDF grammars for source and target languages
(LanguageA and LanguageB).
Next, I write a Stratego program that imports the two grammar
definitions and defines transformation rules and strategies.

My question is: if both languages define a symbol called "Exp", how do
I write a non-ambiguous mapping rule between the two?

A first solution is to rename them at grammar level, so that they are
called something like: AExp, BExp.
I really don't like this option though, as it would make it difficult
to re-use pre-existing grammars and it looks ugly.

I'm sure Stratego provides some more clever mechanism to deal with
this, doesn't it?
For example, in Haskell you would write something in the line of:

import qualified LanguageA as A
import qualified LanguageB as B
...

  trans(A.Exp) = B.Exp

Does anything like this exist in Stratego?
Thanks, Roberto

Hi Roberto,

Welcome to the list and to Stratego.

Are you aware of the Spoofax language workbench:

   http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax

It provides an Eclipse plugin for developing SDF+Stratego programs.

We'll do our best :)

The first answer is a question: are you doing the transformation using
abstract syntax or using concrete syntax?

In the first case, Stratego doesn't care a whole lot about the sorts
in your syntax definition. In transformation by term rewriting you're
mostly concerned in distinguishing abstract syntax constructors. And
your question should then be: How does Stratego distinguish a Var
constructor in source and target language. The answer is that it
doesn't. You may want to design your constructors carefully; there is
no mechanism in SDF/Stratego currently to rename constructors in
grammars.

If you are using concrete syntax then you _do_ want to disambiguate
the sorts in your two grammars. And you don't have to resort to manual
renaming; SDF supports renaming; see the chapter on concrete object
syntax in the tutorial:

http://hydra.nixos.org/build/316727/download/1/manual/chunk-chapter/stratego-concrete-syntax.html

Well, not in Stratego, but in SDF (see link above):

module StrategoTiger
imports Stratego [ Term => StrategoTerm
                   Var => StrategoVar
                   Id => StrategoId
                   StrChar => StrategoStrChar ]

Yes, I've installed it and played a bit with it.
I found it a bit difficult (mainly because my little experience with eclipse)
to setup a project for translation between two languages using abstract syntax
(the example translates to java using concrete syntax, so there is no
need to define an SDF for java).
However, it is my plan to go back to it once I'm more familiar with Stratego/XT,
as I would like to deploy a plugin for embedding editing of my
language in our target application
(it will be a custom language that translates into SQL).

For now my preference is for abstract syntax.
I have to admit that the approach of extending the meta language, as
in StrategoTiger,
is still a bit above my current level of understanding.

I see the point. Still, designing constructors carefully isn't always
very possible, especially if I want to import pre-defined grammar definitions.

Yep, that's what I was looking for, thanks! Not as convenient as the
Haskell mechanism,
which doesn't force renaming of every single Symbol, but still fine.

Many thanks, be sure I'll be soon back with more questions ;)

I have posted this problem a while ago (please, see below). Is there
someone who could give me a help with this?

Many thanks,

complex pointcut expressions
To: developers at strategoxt.org, Users at strategoxt.org


Hi, everybody.

I'm facing some problems while using the parser and the pretty-printer
from AspectJ-front. For instance, when I parse a pointcut expressions
such as:


? ? ? ?protected pointcut subjectChange(Subject subject) :
(((execution(public int GeneralStatement.executeUpdate(..))) &&
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?(!within(SelectStatement))) || (call(protected
List GeneralStatement.executeQueryWithCallback(..)))) &&
this(subject);


the pretty-printed code is as follows:


? ? ? ?protected pointcut subjectChange (Subject subject)
:execution(public int GeneralStatement.executeUpdate(..)) &&
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?!within(SelectStatement) || call(protected List
GeneralStatement.executeQueryWithCallback(..)) && this(subject);


As you can see, some surrounding round brackets are removed, what
results in inconsistent information binding. Other two examples are
shown below (the original aspects are attached).


Is anybody aware of a workaround for this? Is there a way to fix it
(e.g. keeping all round brackets in the pretty-printed version)?

Many thanks!

***************
SCOPE
***************

The increased complexity of Web sites and the explosive growth of
Web-based applications has turned their design and construction into
a challenging problem. Nowadays, many companies have diverted their
Web sites into interactive, completely-automated, Web-based
applications (such as Amazon, on-line banking, or travel agencies)
with a high complexity that requires appropriate specification and
verification techniques and tools. Systematic, formal approaches to
the analysis and verification can address the problems of this
particular domain with automated and reliable tools that also
incorporate semantic aspects.

We solicit original papers on formal methods and techniques applied
to Web sites, Web services or Web-based applications, such as:

* rule-based approaches to Web system analysis,
   certification, specification, verification,
   and optimization
* algebraic methods for verification and certification
   of Web systems
* formal models for describing and reasoning about Web sites
* model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web sites
* analysis and verification of linked data
* abstract interpretation and program transformation
   applied to the semantic Web
* intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for
   Web specifications authoring
* Web quality and Web metrics
* Web usability and accessibility
* Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications

The WWV series provides a forum for researchers from the communities
of Rule-based programming, Automated Software Engineering, and
Web-oriented research to facilitate the cross-fertilization and the
advancement of hybrid methods that combine the three areas.

The previous WWV editions were: WWV'09 (Hagenberg, Austria),
WWV'08 (Siena, Italy), WWV'07 (Venice, Italy), WWV'06 (Paphos, Cyprus),
and WWV'05 (Valencia, Spain).

Subject: [Stratego Users] program transformation projects (Scala.Net
	compiler) for Google Summer of Code
Message-ID: <968EDC0945B54AAC8589878ED2D6EF2C@Miguel>



Hi,

I've been contributing to the Scala compiler project [1], focusing recently 
on its .NET version.

As program transformation fans, you might want to know that the Scala team 
participates in Google Summer of Code [2], where students get paid for 
contributing to open-source projects.

>From that list, the following are about program transformation:

 3. Code Coverage for Scala
 9. A new backend for the Scala.Net compiler to generate C# sources
12. Adding LINQ-awareness to Scala.Net

Your ideas are welcome! For example, here's one more: [3]

If you know students interested in compiler stuff, please let them know 
about these projects.

regards,

Miguel

Subject: [Stratego Users] Too many entries in SDF precedence? (continued)
Message-ID: <16633a591003260818r7ab3bebax5e69164348aaf986@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having a similar problem compiling the Java 1.5 syntax from the Java-front:

Generating parse table ...
generating parsetable from /var/tmp/SL.19274.asfix
[ sdf2rtg | debug ] Invoking tool implodePT at location
/ufs/roberto/local/bin/implodePT with arguments:
        ["-i","/tmp/StrategoXTxeHUVK","-o","/tmp/StrategoXTYHx5fA"]
[ sdf2rtg | warning ] process signaled: SEGV (11): Invalid memory reference

Like for Shannon, it does compile correctly if I take the lowest
precedence entry away from expressions/Priorities.sdf, that would be:
 > {right:
      LHS "="    Expr -> Expr
      LHS "*="   Expr -> Expr
      LHS "/="   Expr -> Expr
      LHS "%="   Expr -> Expr
      LHS "+="   Expr -> Expr
      LHS "-="   Expr -> Expr
      LHS "<<="  Expr -> Expr
      LHS ">>="  Expr -> Expr
      LHS ">>>=" Expr -> Expr
      LHS "&="   Expr -> Expr
      LHS "^="   Expr -> Expr
      LHS "|="   Expr -> Expr
    }

taken away.

Increasing the stack with ulimit -s 16000 did not help.

However, this happens only on a 64-bit machine (aterm patched). The
same works just fine on a 32-bit machine.

On both machines, I'm using the stable versions: aterm-2.5,
sdf2-bundle-2.4, stratego/xt-0.17.
Fedora core 11 RPMs on the 32-bit machine, compiled source tarball on
the 64-bit machine.

Any more thoughts? Shannon, could you find out more about your problem?

Thanks, Roberto

Hi, Rob.

Many thanks for this. I've run preliminary tests using the
"aspectjtree-parenthesize" tool and everything looks fine.

The best,

Hi Robert,

No I never did get to the bottom of that one.  But it would compile on my
supervisors laptop, so I stopped worrying about it.  Try a different
machine?

Cheers,

Shannon

My experience is that this is still a stack size limit issue. Maybe
try ulimit -s unlimited? That seems to work on macs at least. For some
reason these tools need gigantic stacks.

Actually, I'm still having a problem with this.
Which could very well mean that I'm somehow missing the point here,
please shoot if this is the case.

Back to our languages A and B, and an abstract syntax translation from A to B.
Say both their grammars define:

export
   sorts Expr
context-free syntax
   Expr "+" Expr -> Expr {cons("Plus")}

Now, one of my translation rules in stratego would look like:

Plus(a,b) -> Plus(a,b)

Which is ambiguous. However, I cannot rename "Plus" in SDF, as
described above. I can only rename sorts, like Expr, but Plus is no
sort.

What am I missing?
Thanks, Roberto

Hi Roberto,

You're not missing anything. This is the problem that I indicated in
my previous answer; there is no way to rename constructors. There are
two ways to deal with this:

1) consistently rename constructors (manually) in (one of) the grammars

   sed /cons("/cons("A_/g

   might help doing it consistently :) might even put that in the build script

2) live with / work around the ambiguity in the signatures

I agree that this is not quite satisfactory; we need a better way to
control name spaces (or language spaces).

And there is a third approach 1a)

1a) instead of manually changing the grammar or hacking a script to do
it, make the transformation part of SDF,
  i.e. extend SDF with constructor renaming and implement this
renaming as part of SDF normalization.

This would really be more satisfactory. The problem with the latter
solution is that SDF has not been fully integrated
into Stratego/XT. The SDF normalizer and parser generator are
implemented in the sdf2bundle which is imported from
the ASF+SDF meta-environment project, and is not under control of the
Stratego/XT project. Despite years of talking
about the needs for better name space management for SDF, this has not
yet happened. A proper solution would be
to implement the SDF normalizer in Stratego and re-design/extend SDF
with better namespace controls. Volunteers are
welcome.

In the meantime we'll have to live with approaches 1 and 2.

cheers,

Hi Eelco,

Thanks for clarifying this, and for your quick answer on a Saturday night!
I'll probably go for solution 1).
And maybe walk downstairs (I work at CWI) and ask the SDF guys what
their plan/opinion is about this problem.

Cheers, Roberto

Excellent. Would be good to get this going again :)
