Subject: [Stratego Users] PhD position at TU Delft: automatic grading and
 tutoring in online (programming) courses
Message-ID: <CAFaCHU0ov24HyvHE4cMnspTsBOQg1RutZf793Znb=1wXrVt45A@mail.gmail.com>

We have an opening for a PhD student to work on automatic grading and
tutoring in online courses. In particular, we are interested in automatic
feedback and assessment techniques that we can apply in programming
education. The results of the research will be applied and evaluated in
several courses at TU Delft and other universities.

We are looking for a candidate with a Master?s degree (or equivalent) in
computer science or a related discipline, a passion for online education,
and a broad interest including systems programming, compilers, language
engineering, programming environments, web programming, machine learning,
interaction design, education research, and teaching.
