When I run eclipse (after trying to install spoofax) I get this message
from eclipse:

The following arguments are currently missing:

Hi Rustom,

The -Xms, -Xmx and -XX:MaxPermSize are given more than once, that is not supported by the JVM, perhaps that causes the warning message to pop up. I run my Eclipse (Kepler) with:

-vmargs
-Xss32m
-Xms4096m
-Xmx4096m
-XX:MaxPermSize=1G
-server

But that may be a bit overkill.

Dear Rustom,

This is a bug in Spoofax, you can safely ignore the warning about -server.

Cheers,
Gabriel

Invitation to attend the symposium on

The Future of Programming

followed by the inaugural speech of Eelco Visser

TU Delft, 16 and 17 January 2014
---------------------------------------------------------

Software systems are the engines of modern information society. Our ability
to cope
with the increasing complexity of software systems is limited by the
programming
languages we use to build them. Bridging the gap between domain concepts
and
the implementation of these concepts in a programming language is one of
the core
challenges of software engineering. Modern programming languages have
considerably
reduced this gap, but often still require low-level programmatic encodings
of domain
concepts.

## Symposium

On Thursday January 16 and Friday January 17, 2014, TU Delft hosts a
symposium
on the future of programming, which will provide an overview of the
challenges in
software development and programming languages and visions to their
solution from
different angles by a line-up of distinguished national and international
speakers
from academia and industry.

The symposium is followed by the inaugural speech of Eelco Visser on the
occasion
of his appointment as Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Professor at TU Delft.

## Speakers

The following distinguished speakers have confirmed their participation:

* Arie van Deursen: On software changes, large and small. Versioning in the
Maven ecosystem
* Brandon Hill: DSL engineering in industry (Spoofax at Oracle Labs)
* Erik Meijer: Reactive programming (Rx)
* Guido Wachsmuth: Meta-languages for language design (Spoofax)
* Harry Buhrman: Programming quantum computers
* Manuel Serrano: From PCs to tablets: Programming the diffuse Web
* Markus P?schel: Teaching computers to write fast libraries
* Markus V?lter: mbeddr: Extensible languages for embedded software
engineering
* Sebastian Erdweg: Library-based language extensions in SugarJ
* Stefan Hanenberg: User studies of programming language productivity

## Inaugural Speech Eelco Visser

The symposium is followed by Eelco Visser's inaugural speech

    "Programming Languages shape Computational Thinking"

on January 17, 2014 at 15:00 in the TU Delft Aula.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Island grammar problem
Message-ID: <5298AD82.4090307@gmx.ch>

Hi all,

I am doing some experiments using island grammars and SDF. The grammar I
want to create in the end should recognize C preprocessor directives
such as #ifdef, but since I am new to SDF and the concepts behind island
grammars, I have simplified the case a little bit. Therefore I would
like to create a grammar, which is able to recognize UPPERCASE words in
a textfile.

Unfortunately I have tried several examples, but often they didn't seem
to work properly, often there were ambiguities in my parse tree/ AST
(amb). As far as I understand, an island grammar should not have
ambiguities, if implemented correctly, right?

Please find my current grammar definition and commands below. It for
sure contains errors. Could someone perhaps have a look at it and give
me a hint in the right direction?

Just to make sure, here is the tool suite I am using on linux:

aterm-2.5 (including patch)
sdf2-bundle-2.4

I have downloaded them as source files from
http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/StrategoDownload and compiled them on my
machine.


This is my grammar:

Module Layout:
--------------
module layout

exports

  lexical syntax
    [\ \t\n]  -> LAYOUT

Module Water:
-------------
module water

exports

  sorts Water

  lexical syntax
    ~[\ \t\n]+  -> Water {avoid}

Module Main:
------------
module main

imports water
imports layout

exports

  sorts Input Chunk Uppercase
  context-free start-symbols Input

  lexical syntax
    [A-Z]+ -> Uppercase

  context-free syntax
    Chunk*    -> Input  {cons("Input")}
    Water     -> Chunk  {cons("Water")}
    Uppercase -> Chunk  {cons("Uppercase")}


These are the commands I use to create a parse table:

pack-sdf -i layout.sdf -o layout.def
pack-sdf -i water.sdf -o water.def
pack-sdf -i main.sdf -o main.def
sdf2table -i main.def -o main.tbl -m main

To parse a file, I invoke the following command:

cat testdata3.txt | sglri -p main.tbl

The file "testdata3.txt" contains the following data:

Das ist ein Satz mit UPPERCASE und lowercase W?rtern.


Thank you very much for your assistance.

Kind regards,
Andr? Gasser

Hi Andre,

Have a look at our TOPLAS 2012 paper about parse error recovery. The recovery extensions of SDF2/JSGLR may apply to more coarse grained island grammars. But we haven't tried it yet.

Hi Andr?,

I'm by no means an expert in any of this, but I took a look at what you
want to achieve with your grammar and what's ambiguous about it now. I
noticed that you don't use follow restrictions anywhere.
In my experience with SDF I've always needed a follow restriction on LAYOUT
looking like this in your case:

(addition to layout.sdf)
  context-free restrictions
    LAYOUT? -/- [\ \t\n]

Other follow restriction are appropriate in your grammar because if I
understand your goal correctly, you want your lexical syntax to match
greedily. Since this isn't standard in SDF, you need the following
additions:

(addition to water.sdf)
  lexical restrictions
    Water -/- ~[\ \t\n]

(addition to main.sdf)
  lexical restrictions
    Uppercase -/- [A-Z]

With these additions your test file parses in less than a second with only
a few ambiguities left. I added a rather conservative follow restriction to
Uppercase. If you use a much more relaxed follow restriction like ~[\
\t\n], you can get an unambiguous ast from your test file that looks like
this (I used pp-aterm to pretty-print):

Input(
  [ Water("Das")
  , Water("ist")
  , Water("ein")
  , Water("Satz")
  , Water("mit")
  , Uppercase("UPPERCASE")
  , Water("und")
  , Water("lowercase")
  , Water("W?rtern.")
  ]
)

I suspect that this is what you're after.

PS: If you are instead looking for an AST where any uppercase letter gets
its own Uppercase() constructor, then you shouldn't relax the follow
restriction beyond [A-Z]. However I don't know how to make your grammar
unambiguous in that case. I suspect it has to do with the ambiguity being
between matching e.g. Water("Das") by rule Water -> Chunk or
Uppercase("D"), Water("as") by some internal rule generated from Chunk* ->
Input.

I hope this helps with you a bit. For in depth information you should
follow the advice of experts like Eelco.
