Subject: [Stratego Users] Installation of Stratego
Message-ID: <87ioa1zf1y.fsf@gmail.com>

Hi,
I am having trouble installing Stratego.

http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/StrategoDownload
seems to be outdated, the Files won't even download and the
nix packages can't be installed.

It seems that the preferred way is to use Spoofax with eclipse, but I
can't get it to install either

I tried with multiple eclipse versions (4.5 the current down to 4.2.2
which is documented to work on http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax)

on install new software I enter
http://download.spoofax.org/update/stable/
and select all components.

There comes an error message that some dependencies can't be installed.

Can you help me?
For my purposes, having a running stratego shell would be all I need.

thanks,
Maik

Hi Maik,

you might want to try one of our pre-packed Eclipse distributions which include Spoofax already: http://metaborg.org/download/

Hi Maik,

I understand your confusion; the notice about Spoofax redirected to the old
Spoofax site. I have repaired that and added BIG RED BANNERS to the old
Stratego/XT site and redirected from strategoxt.org/Spoofax to the new
http://metaborg.org/spoofax site.

For some reasons, the linux 64 bit version was not working on my linux
laptop, but I succeeded on Windows with the windows 64 bit version. Maybe
there are some issues with my setup...

Anyway, thanks for your help.
Is there a way to start the stratego shell in spoofax? The tour doesn't
show a way and the how to debug question on the faq only mentions the debug
strategy.

We're mostly a Mac shop these days. So our Linux build don't get tested as
well as the mac os x builds.

The Stratego shell was never properly migrated to Spoofax. At some point
there was a hack that allowed use of the shell in the Spoofax console, but
that required an additional Nix installation of the shell, if I remember
correctly.

So these days we get by with 'Spoofax builders' (see Section 4.8 of
http://declare-your-language.metaborg.org/). It is a bit cumbersome since
it requires a full build cycle. But the advantage is that you can apply
transformations directly to a program in an editor.

Hopefully the new Spoofax Core will make it easier to develop shell
interfaces to languages again.

cheers,

ANNEX: WORKSHOP ABSTRACTS AND DATES
**************************************************************
AGERE! 5th International Workshop on Programming based on Actors, Agents, and Decentralized Control
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/agere2015

-Deadlines:
Abstracts: August 1, 2015
Submissions: August 7, 2015
Position/work-in-progress Papers and Demos: September 7, 2015

- Organizers:
Elisa Gonzalez Boix, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium
Philipp Haller, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden
Alessandro Ricci, University of Bologna, Italy
Carlos Varela, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

- Abstract:
The AGERE! workshop is aimed at focusing on programming systems, languages and applications based on actors, active/concurrent objects, agents and ? more generally ? high-level programming paradigms promoting a mindset of decentralized control in solving problems and developing software. The workshop is designed to cover both the theory and the practice of design and programming, bringing together researchers working on models, languages and technologies, and practitioners developing real-world systems and applications.


**************************************************************
DSM - Domain-Specific Modeling workshop
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/dsm2015

- Deadlines:
Submissions: August 7, 2015

- Organizers:
Jeff Gray, University of Alabama, USA
Jonathan Sprinkle, University of Arizona, USA
Juha-Pekka Tolvanen, MetaCase, Finland
Matti Rossi, Aalto University School of Economics, Finland

- Abstract:
Domain-specific languages provide a viable and time-tested solution for continuing to raise the level of abstraction, and thus productivity, beyond coding, making systems development faster and easier. When accompanied with suitable automated modeling tools and generators it delivers to the promises of continuous delivery and devops. In Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) the models are constructed using concepts that represent things in the application domain, not concepts of a given programming language. The modeling language follows the domain abstractions and semantics, allowing developers to perceive themselves as working directly with domain concepts. Together with frameworks and platforms, DSM can automate a large portion of software production. This automation is possible because of domain-specificity: both the modeling language and code generators fit to the requirements of a narrowly defined domain, often inside one organization only.

ETX - Eclipse Technology eXchange Workshop
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/etx2015

- Deadlines:
Abstracts: July 31, 2015
Submissions: August 7, 2015

- Organizers:
Tim Verbelen, Ghent University - iMinds, Belgium
Michael Burke, Rice University, USA

- Abstract:
The Eclipse platform (http://www.eclipse.org) was originally designed for building integrated development environments for object-oriented applications. Over the years it has developed into a vibrant ecosystem of platforms, toolkits, libraries, modeling frameworks, and tools that support various languages and programming styles. The goal of the ETX workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas about potential new uses of Eclipse and how Eclipse technology can be leveraged, improved, and/or extended for research and education. After successful editions of the ETX workshop in 2003-2007, we revived the ETX workshop in 2014 and are now up for another edition. ETX 2015 invites original and unpublished contributions about potential new uses of Eclipse and how Eclipse technology can be leveraged, improved, and/or extended for research and education.

We are looking for transformative ideas outside the academic and industrial mainstream - ideas with potentially large impacts on how we will build software in the future. We embrace early-stage work, when it is most in need of constructive criticism, and offer a safe and effective environment in which to receive such criticism.

MobileDeLi - Workshop on Mobile Development Lifecycle
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/mobiledeli2015

- Deadlines:
Submissions: August 7, 2015

- Organizers:
Aharon Abadi, IBM Haifa Research Lab, Israel
Lori Flynn, CERT, USA
Jeff Gray, University of Alabama, USA

- Abstract:
Mobile application usage and development is experiencing exponential growth. According to Gartner, by 2016 more than 200 billion total apps will have been downloaded. The mobile domain presents new challenges to software engineering. Mobile platforms are rapidly changing, including diverse capabilities as GPS, sensors, and input modes. Applications must be omni-channel and work on all platforms.
Activated on mobile platforms, modern applications must be elastic and scale on demand according to the hardware abilities. Applications often need to support and use third-party services. Therefore, during development, security and authorization processes for the dataflow must be applied. Bring your own device (BYOD) policies bring new security data leaks challenges. Developing such applications requires suitable practices and tools e.g., architecture techniques that relate to the complexity at hand; improved refactoring tools for hybrid applications using dynamic languages and polyglot development and applications; and testing techniques for applications that run on different devices. This workshop aims at establishing a community of researchers and practitioners to share their work and lead further research in the mobile development area.

PLATEAU ? 6th Workshop on Evaluation and Usability of Programming Languages and Tools
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/plateau2015

- Deadlines:
Submissions: August 7, 2015

- Organizers:
Thomas LaToza, UC Irvine, USA
Joshua Sunshine, Carnegie Mellon University, USA
Craig Anslow, Middlesex University, UK

- Abstract:
Programming languages exist to enable programmers to develop software effectively. But how efficiently programmers can write software depends on the usability of the languages and tools that they develop with. The aim of this workshop is to discuss methods, metrics and techniques for evaluating the usability of languages and language tools. The supposed benefits of such languages and tools cover a large space, including making programs easier to read, write, and maintain; allowing programmers to write more flexible and powerful programs; and restricting programs to make them more safe and secure. PLATEAU gathers the intersection of researchers in the programming language, programming tool, and human-computer interaction communities to share their research and discuss the future of evaluation and usability of programming languages and tools.

- Deadlines:
Submissions: August 7, 2015

- Organizers:
Ali Afroozeh,
Loek Cleophas, Umea University, Sweden

- Abstract:
Parsing at SLE is a workshop on parsing programming languages, now in its third edition. The intended participants are the authors of parser generation tools and parsers for programming languages and other software languages. For the purpose of this workshop ``parsing?? is a computation that takes a sequence of characters as input and produces a syntax tree or graph as output. This possibly includes tokenization using regular expressions, deriving trees using context- free grammars, and mapping to abstract syntax trees. The goal is to bring together today?s experts in the field of parsing, in order to explore open questions and possibly forge new collaborations. The topics may include algorithms, implementation and generation techniques, syntax and semantics of meta formalisms (BNF), etc.

REBLS - Workshop on Reactive and Event-based Languages & Systems
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/rebls2015

- Deadlines:
Submissions: August 7, 2015

Patrick Eugster, Purdue University, USA
Lukasz Ziarek, State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo, USA

Reactive programming and event-based programming are two closely related programming styles that are becoming ever more important with the advent of advanced HPC technology and the ever increasing requirement for our applications to run on the web or on collaborating mobile devices. A number of publications on middleware and language design ? so-called reactive and event-based languages and systems (REBLS) ? have already seen the light, but the field still raises several questions. For example, the interaction with mainstream language concepts is poorly understood, implementation technology is in its infancy and modularity mechanisms are almost totally lacking. Moreover, large applications are still to be developed and patterns and tools for developing reactive applications is an area that is vastly unexplored.

Ehsan Atoofian, Lakehead University, Canada
Yukionri Sato, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan

- Abstract:
The increased complexity of parallel applications on modern parallel platforms (e.g. multicore/manycore, distributed or hybrid) requires more insight into development processes, and necessitates the use of advanced methods and techniques supporting developers in creating parallel applications or parallelizing and reengineering sequential legacy applications. We aim to advance the state of the art in different phases of parallel software development, covering software engineering aspects such as requirements engineering and software specification; design and implementation; program analysis, profiling and tuning; testing and debugging.

SMART - Workshop on Smart Software Strategies
http://conf.researchr.org/track/SmartSoftwareStrategies2015/SmartSoftwareStrategies2015

- Deadlines:
Papers: October 2, 2015

- Organizers:
Steven D. Fraser, Independent Consultant, USA
Dennis Mancl, Alcatel-Lucent, USA
Bill Opdyke, JP Morgan Chase & Co, USA

- Abstract:
We should learn from the past ? to use what we learn for the next problem. What can we learn from the experiences of Y2K? There are some lessons about software design and software maintenance that we might apply to the next wave of software and technology:

Y2K bugs: In the late 1990s, software developers and managers were furiously working to analyze and fix potential ?Y2K bugs.? We all knew that there were software applications that might fail on January 1, 2000, but no one was sure how we would manage to fix all of these defects in time.
Today?s ?smart? technologies: Fifteen years later, we are at the threshold of a new era of software ? smart phones, wearable technology, digital currency, smart automobiles, smart power grids, smart appliances. How should we prepare for this wave? Should we be thinking ahead, should we be anticipating some of the potential risks and latent defects in our smart applications and smart support software for a software-driven future world?
What advances in software analysis, design, coding, and testing will we need to do reduce our exposure to defects, unintended side effects, and malicious mischief? We might look to the past ? to the biggest concentrated effort to clean up and modernize software on a worldwide scale. Are there some lessons we can learn from ?Y2K remediation activities? of the 1990s?

WODA - 13th International Workshop on Dynamic Analysis
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/woda2015

- Deadlines:
Papers: August 7, 2015

- Organizers:
Harry Xu, University of California, Irvine, USA
Walter Binder, University of Lugano, Switzerland
Yudi Zheng, University of Lugano, Switzerland

- Abstract:
Dynamic analysis is widely used in software development to understand various run-time properties of a program. Dynamic analysis includes both offline techniques, which operate on some captured representation of the program's behavior (e.g., a trace), and run-time techniques, which analyze the behavior on the fly, while the system is executing. Although inherently incomplete, dynamic analyses can be more precise than their static counterparts and show promise in aiding the understanding, development, and maintenance of robust and reliable large scale systems. Moreover, the data they provide enable statistical inferences to be made about program behavior. Dynamic analysis is playing a central role in the understanding of applications and systems as we grapple with emerging challenges such as systemic runtime bloat, high energy consumption, and the explosion of Big Data. The overall goal of WODA is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in all areas of dynamic analysis to discuss new issues, share results and ongoing work, and foster collaborations. This workshop is a forum for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of compilers, programming languages, architecture, software engineering, systems, high-performance computing, performance engineering, machine learning, and data mining for addressing software and system performance. The workshop focuses on developing and studying analytic technologies (e.g., program analysis, statistical analysis, machine learning, data mining, visualization) applied on various software or system artifacts (e.g., production systems, tests, program traces, system logs) to address issues in software and system reliability, dependability, performance, and scalability.
