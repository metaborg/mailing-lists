Thanks for the extremely quick responses Lenart and Guido. And for
Stratego/Spoofax in general.

OK, that makes sense, sorry I didn't think to try that (my previous
experience is primarily with ANTLR which being LL doesn't really have a
concept of start rules except as a hint to other tools).
Are there any issues with having large numbers of start symbols in the
grammar (apart from neatness of code)? This could instead be done with the
nice template features of the unit testing language. Is that better in
terms of performance?

Many thanks,
Tom.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Ctrl-click fails on terms followed by a * in SDF
 editor / ALLOW_MULTI_CHILD_PARENT implication
Message-ID: <CAEXdecncWRVF4xD=ZQr8ZPq+DVyRjUme3pRtdZ_E0ETTaZdmOw@mail.gmail.com>

Both stable and nightly version of Spoofax have a problem with reference
resolving that appears when using Ctrl+Click in the SDF editor. Ctrl+Click
fails on terms of the form Definition* or (Definition)*, but not on terms
of the form (Definition Definition)*.

I've noticed that StrategoReferenceResolver.ALLOW_MULTI*_*CHILD_PARENT is
set to 'false' since r22534. Reverting it back to 'true' gives the correct
behaviour. I don't know the implications of reverting it to 'true'. Maybe
Lennart Kats, who made this modification in r22534, can tell us more on the
implication of changing the value of ALLOW_MULTI*_*CHILD_PARENT.

Hey Thomas,

The interactive console relies on a libstratego-lib.ctree file being
installed through nix, and this is not really possible on Windows. There's
a issue about this on Yellowgrass: http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/499.

Cheers,
Gabri?l

Hi Emmanuel,

This was an interface change described in 
http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/358. The SDF editor may have to be 
updated to cope with this.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Disambiguator option leaves additional information
	in AST
Message-ID: <CAM5MpD7yF0B9gGZ5cNhSw7nWvrG9-0HxMF4pxCW=P2mkcJ7uFA@mail.gmail.com>

Adding a custom disambiguator through the disambiguator option in
LANG.Main.esv adds information (source file and project location) to the
AST. This breaks any tests that check the AST structure. Is it intended
that the disambiguator should also remove this information or is it an
oversight that it is not removed after invoking the custom disambiguator
(or at least before tests, I haven't noticed any ill effect on the
generated editor)?
The information is added by the call to
myRuntime.getInputBuilder().makeInputTerm() in
org.strategoxt.imp.runtime.parser.CustomDisambiguator.disambiguate().

Thanks,
Tom.

Would be even cooler if we can drop the dependency and integrate
everything in Eclipse / on the JVM. Is there a problem with doing
that, Karl?

Thanks for the info Gabri?l.

I did manage to get it at least partially working on Windows.
I did this by extracting the files from the Cygwin distribution of
StrategoXT (http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/StrategoDownload) to the
expected nix profile path. Though the Cygwin distribution didn't
include the libstratego-tool-doc.ctree so I used the copy from Hydra
(http://hydra.nixos.org/build/790262/contents/1). I guess this may
cause issues with that library, the Cygwin distribution includes only
the rtree for that file so I'm not sure if that's because the ctree
version will not work or just an oversight.
With that the console does load and I am able to execute basic
commands. Though I do note that the extra shell commands (:help, :vars
etc) do not work, resulting in "Syntax error near unexpected character
':' at line 1, column 1". I gathered those commands should work here,
or am I mistaken there?

The comment from Karl in that bug report suggest that it was intended
that these files were bundled in the eclipse jars, and indeed the
org.spoofax.interpreter jar includes the needed files (apart from
libstratego-tool-doc.ctree) but only the frontend.ctree is loaded from
there, the other files are loaded from the nix profile path. Was it
found that bundling them in the jars was not a workable solution or is
it just that it has not yet been looked at?

Thanks,
Tom.

I think it is interesting to have the different editors (SDF, Stratego),
which are mainly Stratego code, in separate projects. For the rest, I don't
see any need to split the Java code in many projects, but I am maybe to
naive?

I've successfully set up a concrete syntax for a tiny project. The problems
that I've encountered are:
? The sample project has a strange Enfungenerated.sdf file that reports
error in Spoofax r25227 (unstable). It is not a really problem, but as
there are transient errors in the editor, it gives a fuzzy impression of
failure, while it actually works.
? Sometime, one requires more that one Eclipse restart to make things work.

Is there a simple way (command line?) to get the desugared normalized
version of the .str file. I.e. a .sdf file
in which toMetaExpr elements are converted to the standard Op and List.
(what is NoAnnoList?)

Subject: [Stratego Users] Questions - mailing list, yellowgrass,
	StackOverflow
Message-ID: <CADbG_jZ9WvDXtnRuYMNpFPq+AnqZRHgXLj0+8NHDo2PrGXsy=w@mail.gmail.com>

Following up on a thread in issue #559 ...
http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/559

There's a question of where should people best post questions:

   1. The mailing list
   2. YellowGrass
   3. StackOverflow (or something like it)


If the core team were to monitor StackOverflow for certain tags like
"Spoofax" and "StrategoXT" then users could post their questions on stack
overflow.  You just want to advertise this fact on the Spoofax web site.

The benefits of using a Stack Overflow tag include:

   1. Great SEO - Google favors StackOverflow threads highly for whatever
   reason, so a google search like "Spoofax line numbers" is more likely to
   give a good hit on SO than on yellowgrass or a mailing list archive
   2. The user interface is very good, certainly worlds better than the
   mailing list and still a fair bit better than YellowGrass
   3. The questions are persistent and easily searchable (compared to the
   mailing list approach which)
   4. It saves YellowGrass for just tracking bugs, so whoever is
   responsible for keeping YellowGrass tidy and updated will have less work
   5. It may allow you to terminate the existence of the mailing list
   altogether (bugs & suggestions go in YellowGrass and questions can go to
   StackOverflow)

The main drawback is that it's an extra step for the team to monitor a
StackOverflow tag, and if they forget to do so they'll leave questions
unanswered which is a bad user experience.  But see here for some
subscription options (RSS, Email):
http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/25224/email-notifications-for-new-questions-matching-specific-tags

Subject: [Stratego Users] SDF question
Message-ID: <CALq5ZdySR7NdpgJvW2Qsp-mY6mj9KbAWzbYEHGdpvrowaUzS+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to write transformations for an assembly like language. The
problem is the language has a very basic notion of blocks; only the
beginnings are marked. So it is hard to write a transformation that
gets all the instructions in a block and puts them into a separate
block. I'm wondering whether while parsing, I can associate an
instruction with a block. For example, I have the following program:

block<1>:
ins1
ins2
ins3
...
block<2>
ins10
int11

in the parse tree I would like to have, each node to have an attribute
that holds the block number.
So something like
Block("1")[Instruction(Block("1")[..] Instruction(Block("1"))[...]
...]Block("2")[Instruction(Block("2"))[...]....]

Is this possible with SDF? I appriciate it if you can help me out with
this issue, I could not find much on SDF documentation.

Thanks in advance,
Selim

SDF alone might not give you exactly that tree, you would have to transform
the tree, maybe using Stratego. SDF will only put each input into the
output tree one time. You could get a tree like Block("1",[...]) from SDF
pretty easily I think. It's easy to transform that to the format you
describe.

The problem with StackExchange is you can only set notifications for tags,
not searches. If someone asks a question about Spoofax/Stratego without
tagging the question correctly, we will not see it.
Also, 'Stratego' is not a very good term for searching:
http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=stratego

We had the idea of hosting our own StackExchange-like site, such as
http://www.osqa.net/ or http://askbot.com/, but we still need to actually
do this.
I think that's the best way to go for QA from users and also developers.
The mailing list should probably stay, for discussions and other things
that don't fit on the QA site.
Yellowgrass, or whatever tracking software we use is then used for bug
tracking, suggestions, feature requests, etc.
