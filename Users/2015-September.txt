Thanks for the report, I've changed our build to generate tar.gz files for
Linux and OSX:
http://buildfarm.metaborg.org/job/spoofax-master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/dist/eclipse/.
I tested the OSX versions, the Linux x86_64 versions in a VM, and the
Windows versions in a VM, and they have the correct symlinks and
permissions now. I could not test the Linux x86 versions because I don't
have a 32 bits Linux installation, would be great if someone else could
test that.

** OOPSLA Research Papers**
Papers that address any aspect of software development are welcome,
including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation,
generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance,
reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems. Papers may address
these topics in a variety of ways, including new tools (such as languages,
program analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as
methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and
management techniques), and new evaluations (such as formalisms and proofs,
corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/oopsla2015

** Onward! Research Papers **
Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to
do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages,
communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and
more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet
proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and
reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/onward2015-papers


** Onward! Essays **
Onward! Essays is looking for clear and compelling pieces of writing about
topics important to the software community. An essay can be an exploration
of a topic, its impact, or the circumstances of its creation; it can
present a personal view of what is, explore a terrain, or lead the reader
in an act of discovery; it can be a philosophical digression or a deep
analysis. It can describe a personal journey, perhaps that by which the
author reached an understanding of such a topic. The subject area should be
interpreted broadly and can include the relationship of software to human
endeavors, or its philosophical, sociological, psychological, historical,
or anthropological underpinnings.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/onward2015-essays

** DLS - Dynamic Languages Symposium **
DLS is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to share
knowledge and research on dynamic languages, their implementation, and
applications. The influence of dynamic languages ? from Lisp to Smalltalk
to Python to Javascript ? on real-world practice, and research, continues
to grow. We invite high quality papers reporting original research,
innovative contributions, or experience related to dynamic languages, their
implementation, and applications.

Keynote: Declare Your Language
Speaker: Eelco Visser (Delft University of Technology)

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/dls2015

** Panels **
The Panels track offers exciting discussion about topics related to SPLASH.

Panel: Software Professionalism ? Is it ?Good Enough??
With: Dennis Mancl, Nancy Mead, Mary Shaw, Werner Wild
http://2015.splashcon.org/event/splash2015-panels-software-professionalism-is-it-good-enough-

Panel: The Future of Programming Languages and Programmers
With: Lars Bak, Rob DeLine, Nick Feamster, Lindsey Kuper, Crista Lopes,
Peng Wu
http://2015.splashcon.org/event/splash2015-panels-the-future-of-programming-languages-and-programmers

** SPLASH-E **
The SPLASH-E track brings together researchers and educators to share
educational results, ideas, and challenges centered in Software and
Programming Languages. Submission formats vary, including papers, tool
demos, lightning talks, challenge-topics for discussion, and suggested
themes for "unconference" sessions.  Help us create an engaging forum for
educational issues related to SPLASH!

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash-e


** Artifacts **
The Artifact Evaluation process is a service provided by the community to
help authors of accepted papers provide more substantial supplements to
their papers so future researchers can more effectively build on and
compare with previous work. The Artifact Evaluation Committee has been
formed to assess how well paper authors prepare artifacts in support of
such future researchers. Roughly, authors of papers who wish to participate
are invited to submit an artifact that supports the conclusions of the
paper.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-artifacts


** Workshops **
The SPLASH Workshops track will host a variety of high-quality workshops
(13 in total), allowing their participants to meet and discuss research
questions with peers, to mature new and exciting ideas, and to build up
communities and start new collaborations. SPLASH workshops complement the
main tracks of the conference and provide meetings in a smaller and more
specialized setting. Workshops cultivate new ideas and concepts for the
future, optionally recorded in formal proceedings.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-workshops

Selected Workshop keynotes:

- AGERE! Daniel Wendel,
  Concurrent, Distributed Thinking for First-time Programmers in StarLogo
Nova

- MobileDeLi: Robert Seacord
  Mobile Security

- PLATEAU: Mary Beth Rosson
  Computational Thinking for All: Expanding the Boundaries of Computing for
Nonprogrammers

- Parsing at SLE: Christian K?stner
  Parsing Unpreprocessed C Code - The TypeChef Experience

- WODA: Koushik Sen
  Concolic Testing: A Decade Later


** Tutorials **
The SPLASH Tutorials track will consist of prestigious tutorials on current
topics in software, systems, and languages research. The scope of the
tutorials is the same as the conference itself: all aspects of software
construction and delivery at the intersection of programming, languages,
and software engineering. The tutorials in particular focus on the nexus
between research and practice, including work that takes inspiration from
or builds connections to areas not commonly considered at SPLASH. Tutorials
should introduce researchers to current research in an area, or show
important new tools that can be used in research.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-tutorials


** Demos **
The SPLASH Demonstrations track is an excellent vehicle for sharing your
latest work with an experienced and technically savvy audience. Live
demonstrations show the impact of software innovation. Demonstrations are
not product sales pitches, but rather an opportunity to highlight, explain,
and present interesting technical aspects of running applications in a
dynamic and highly interactive setting. Presenters are encouraged to
actively solicit feedback from the audience, which should lead to very
interesting and entertaining demonstration sessions.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-demos


** Posters **
The SPLASH Poster track provides an excellent forum for authors to present
their recent or ongoing projects in an interactive setting, and receive
feedback from the community. We invite submissions covering any aspect of
programming, systems, languages and applications. The goal of the poster
session is to encourage and facilitate small groups of individuals
interested in a technical area to gather and interact. It is held early in
the conference, to promote continued discussion among interested parties.
Posters can be independent presentations or associated with one of the
other parts of SPLASH.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-posters


** Doctoral Symposium **
The SPLASH Doctoral Symposium provides students with useful guidance for
completing their dissertation research and beginning their research
careers. The Symposium will provide an interactive forum for doctoral
students who have progressed far enough in their research to have a
structured proposal, but will not be defending their dissertation in the
next 12 months.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-ds


** Student Research Competition **
The ACM SIGPLAN Student Research Competition (ACM SRC) is an
internationally-recognized venue that enables undergraduate and graduate
students to experience the research world, share their research results
with other students and SPLASH attendees. The competition has separate
categories for undergraduate and graduate students and awards prizes to the
top three students in each category. The ACM SIGPLAN Student Research
Competition shares the Poster session?s goal to facilitate interaction with
researchers and industry practitioners; providing both sides with the
opportunity to learn of ongoing, current research.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-src


** PLMW - Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop **

The purpose of Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) is to give
promising undergraduate students from around Pittsburgh who consider
pursuing a graduate degree in this field an overview of what research in
this field looks like and how to get into and succeed in graduate school.
In other words, a combination whirlwind tour of this research area,
networking opportunity, and how-to-succeed guide. The program of PLMW will
include talks by prominent researchers of the field of programming
languages and software engineering providing an insight in their research.

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-plmw


** RPG Richard's Pretty Good Talks **

RPG is my micro-conference. RPG is sporadically held, suddenly announced,
and leaves little but mental limps and frustration / aka instability?take
it as step #1 toward getting you decanalized. I choose the speakers and I
don?t care what you think; I choose the topics and I always choose first
loves. I want people telling me about things they cherish / not about how
they make their living. Here?s what I?ve got going this year for the third
edition.

- Crista Lopes & Annette Vee, Programming as Writing (and vice versa?)
- Billy Price & William Pollak, Singing the Blues / What is a Song?

** SLE - 8th International ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Software Language
Engineering **

Software Language Engineering (SLE) is the application of systematic,
disciplined, and measurable approaches to the development, use, deployment,
and maintenance of software languages. The term ?software language? is used
broadly, and includes: general-purpose programming languages;
domain-specific languages (e.g. BPMN, Simulink, Modelica); modeling and
metamodeling languages (e.g. SysML and UML); data models and ontologies
(e.g. XML-based and OWL-based languages and vocabularies).

Keynote Speaker: Stephane Ducasse (Inria)

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/sle2015


** GPCE - 14th International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts
& Experiences **

The International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts &
Experiences (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested
in techniques that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and
component deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software
quality, and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition
to exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to
foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the
programming languages research communities.

Keynote Speaker: Priya Narasimhan (Carnegie Mellon University)

http://2015.splashcon.org/track/gpce2015


** DBPL - 15th Symposium on Database Programming Languages **

For over 25 years, DBPL has established itself as the principal venue for
publishing and discussing new ideas at the intersection of databases and
programming languages. Many key contributions in query languages for
object-oriented data, persistent databases, nested relational data, and
semistructured data, as well as fundamental ideas in types for query
languages, were first announced at DBPL. This creative research area is
broadening into a subfield of data-centric computation, currently scattered
among a range of venues. DBPL is an established destination for such new
ideas and solicits submissions from researchers in databases, programming
languages or any other community interested in the design, implementation
or foundations of data-centric computation.

Keynote: Gremlin: A Stream-Based Functional Language for OLTP and OLAP

** PLoP - 22nd International Conference on Pattern Languages of Programming
**

The Pattern Languages of Programs (PLoP) conference is a premier event for
pattern authors and pattern enthusiasts to gather, discuss and learn more
about patterns and software development. The conference promotes
development of pattern languages on all aspects of software, including
design and programming, software architecture, user interface design,
domain modeling, software processes, project management, and more. The
program offers pattern authors an unique opportunity to have their pattern
languages reviewed by fellow authors, which occurs mainly in the form of
Writers? Workshops.
