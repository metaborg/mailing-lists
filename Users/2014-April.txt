I have downloaded strategoxt-superbundle-0.17-cygwin.tar.gz and have
extracted it into cygwin/opt. I can invoke strc in Cygwin Bash shell, but
there isn't a stratego-shell.exe in any bin directory. Where can I find the
Stratego shell?

I have also installed Spoofax into my Eclipse, and I can invoke Java
version strc by this command:
java -jar
"d:/eclipse/plugins/org.strategoxt.strj_0.17.92.201310212315/java/strategoxt.jar"

But I still did not found out where stratego-shell is, for neither C
version nor Java version.

Message-ID: <53486B92.4050303@cs.au.dk>

======================================================================

                Call for papers
            16th International Symposium on
       Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming
                   PPDP 2014

         Canterbury, Kent, September 8-10, 2014
             (co-located with LOPSTR 2014)

          http://users-cs.au.dk/danvy/ppdp14/

======================================================================

           SUBMISSION DEADLINE: 15 MAY, 2014

PPDP 2014 is a forum that brings together researchers from the
declaratrive programming communities, including those working in the
logic, constraint and functional programming paradigms, but also
embracing languages, database languages, and knowledge representation
languages. The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical
formalisms and methods for specifying, performing, and analyzing
computations, including mechanisms for mobility, modularity,
concurrency, object-orientation, security, verification and static
analysis. Papers related to the use of declarative paradigms and tools
in industry and education are especially solicited. Topics of interest
include, but are not limited to

* Functional programming
* Logic programming
* Answer-set programming
* Functional-logic programming
* Declarative visual languages
* Constraint Handling Rules
* Parallel implementation and concurrency
* Monads, type classes and dependent type systems
* Declarative domain-specific languages
* Termination, resource analysis and the verification of declarative
programs
* Transformation and partial evaluation of declarative languages
* Language extensions for security and tabulation
* Probabilistic modeling in a declarative language and modeling reactivity
* Memory management and the implementation of declarative systems
* Practical experiences and industrial application

This year the conference will be co-located with the 24th
International Symposium on Logic-Based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2014).

The conference will be held in Canterbury, UK. Previous symposia were
held at Madrid (Spain), Leuven (Belgium), Odense (Denmark), Hagenberg
(Austria), Coimbra (Portugal), Valencia (Spain), Wroclaw (Poland),
Venice (Italy), Lisboa (Portugal), Verona (Italy), Uppsala (Sweden),
Pittsburgh (USA), Florence (Italy), Montreal (Canada), and Paris
(France). You might have a look at the contents of past PPDP symposia.

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal,
conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of
questions).

After the symposium, a selection of the best papers will be invited to
extend their submissions in the light of the feedback solicited at the
symposium. The papers are expected to include at least 30% extra
material over and above the PPDP version. Then, after another round of
reviewing, these revised papers will be published in a journal.

=================== Call for Papers ===================

International Workshop on
DSL Architecting and DSL-based Architectures (DADA'14)

August 26, 2014; Vienna, Austria
https://dada.wu.ac.at/

co-located with

8th European Conference on Software Architecture
Vienna, Austria
http://ecsa2014.cs.univie.ac.at/

The workshop proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

=======================================================

*** Important Dates ***

- Submission due: June 15, 2014, UTC+13 (Samoa time)
- Notification: June 30, 2014
- Camera-ready copy:  July 7, 2014
- Early registration: July 31, 2014
- Workshop: August 26, 2014

*** Overview ***

Domain-specific software languages (DSLs) have received considerable
attention over the last two decades. DSLs are specifically tailored to
the needs of a particular problem or application domain. The promise
of DSLs is that domain experts (from technical as well as
non-technical domains) can understand, validate, modify, test, and
sometimes even develop models and software programs using DSLs.

Domain-specific language engineering involves architectural
decision-making in different phases of the development process. For
example, DSL engineers can choose from different options on how to
realize a DSL's language model (abstract syntax), on the DSL style to
be adopted (internal vs. external DSLs), on the means to define a
DSL's semantics, on the concrete syntax style (e.g. graphical,
textual, or both), and on critical technology choices (e.g., host
languages, language workbenches, metamodeling infrastructure). The DSL
as well as the corresponding infrastructure components (such as
parser, generator, or DSL editor) form parts of the respective
software architecture, often assisting in realizing a particular
architectural style, pattern, or tactic.

*** Workshop Topics ***

Despite the growing popularity of DSL-based architectures and a
considerable body of knowledge on DSL engineering, there is little
documented evidence and reflection on DSL-related architectural
knowledge and DSL-based architectures. Therefore, we are looking for
contributions on, but not limited to, the following topics:


- Architectural designs adopting domain-specific software languages
 (DSLs);

- Architectural concerns of DSLs;

- Architectural viewpoints on DSLs;

- Quality attributes of DSLs and DSL-based software systems (e.g.,
 maintainability, testability, usability);

- Applying architectural patterns, styles, and tactics for engineering
 DSLs;

- Architectural design rationale (ADR) in DSL engineering;

- Process models and guidelines for developing DSLs and DSL-based
 software architectures; 

- Engineering Architecture Description Languages (ADLs) and
 Architecture DSLs (ADSLs);

- Empirical studies on applying architectural knowledge and on
 documenting ADR in engineering DSLs or DSL-based software systems;

- Software tools and development environments for architecture-aware
 DSL engineering;

*** Keynote ***

Markus V?lter will give a keynote on "Architecting Architecture DSLs":

"Architecture DSLs are a useful tool to capture the cornerstones of
platform or product line architectures. In addition, interesting
analyses can be performed on the models, and much of the
infrastructure and configuration code can be generated. On the flip
side, these DSLs themselves must be architected consciously: while
many architectural abstractions are specific to any given platform or
product line, many other aspects are generic and hence can be reused
for several architecture DSLs. In this talk I trace how my thinking on
architecture modeling has changed over time, and how this is reflected
in the archticture DSLs I have built (or helped to build), and how
evolving tools have made these changes possible."

See http://www.voelter.de/ for some background on Markus.

*** Submissions ***

We invite short papers (4 pages long) and full papers (8 pages) in ACM
proceedings format:

http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

Full papers report on research results regarding one or several of the 
above topics. Short papers may report on future research, research-in-progress, 
and position statements. The papers will be reviewed by 2 (short papers) or 
3 PC members (full papers), respectively.

Manuscripts must be submitted using easychair.org:

https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dada2014

Accepted papers will published in the ACM Digital Library as part of
the joint ECSA workshop proceedings.
