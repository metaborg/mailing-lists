*********************************************************************
FIRST CALL FOR TALK PROPOSALS

DSLDI 2015

Third Workshop on
Domain-Specific Language Design and Implementation

July 7, 2015
Prague, Czech Republic
Co-located with ECOOP

http://2015.ecoop.org/track/dsldi-2015-papers
*********************************************************************

Deadline for talk proposals: 2nd of April, 2015

If designed and implemented well, domain-specific languages (DSLs) combine
the best features of general-purpose programming languages (e.g.,
performance) with high productivity (e.g., ease of programming).

*** Workshop Goal ***

The goal of the DSLDI workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners interested in sharing ideas on how DSLs should be designed,
implemented, supported by tools, and applied in realistic application
contexts. We are both interested in discovering how already known domains
such as graph processing or machine learning can be best supported by DSLs,
but also in exploring new domains that could be targeted by DSLs. More
generally, we are interested in building a community that can drive forward
the development of modern DSLs.

*** Workshop Format ***

DSLDI is a single-day workshop and will consist of a series of short talks
whose main goal is to trigger exchange of opinion and discussions. The
talks should be on the topics within DSLDI's area of interest, which
include but are not limited to the following ones:

* DSL implementation techniques, including compiler-level and runtime-level
solutions
* utilization of domain knowledge for driving optimizations of DSL
implementations
* utilizing DSLs for managing parallelism and hardware heterogeneity
* DSL performance and scalability studies
* DSL tools, such as DSL editors and editor plugins, debuggers, refactoring
tools, etc.
* applications of DSLs to existing as well as emerging domains, for
  example graph processing, image processing, machine learning, analytics,
robotics, etc.
* practitioners reports, for example descriptions of DSL deployment i  a
real-life production setting

*** Call for Submissions ***

We solicit talk proposals in the form of short abstracts (max. 2 pages). A
good talk proposal describes an interesting position, demonstration, or
early achievement. The submissions will be reviewed on relevance and
clarity, and used to plan the mostly interactive sessions of the workshop
day. Publication of accepted abstracts and slides on the website is
voluntary.

* Deadline for talk proposals: April 2nd, 2015
* Notification: May 1st, 2015
* Workshop: July 7th, 2015
* Submission website: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dsldi2015

                          CALL FOR PAPERS

                              WGP 2015

           11th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Generic Programming
                         Vancouver, Canada
                       Sunday, August 30, 2015

                   http://www.wgp-sigplan.org/2015

                         Co-located with the
   International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2015)
======================================================================


Goals of the workshop
---------------------

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making
them more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds
of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably
instantiating their parameters. In contrast with normal programs, the
parameters of a generic program are often quite rich in structure; for
example they may be other programs, types or type constructors, class
hierarchies, or even programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to
practitioners and to theoreticians, and, for at least 20 years,
generic programming techniques have been a specific focus of research
in the functional and object-oriented programming communities. Generic
programming has gradually spread to more and more mainstream
languages, and today is widely used in industry. This workshop brings
together leading researchers and practitioners in generic programming
from around the world, and features papers capturing the state of the
art in this important area.

We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical as well as
practical, of

 * generic programming,
 * programming with (C++) concepts,
 * meta-programming,
 * programming with type classes,
 * programming with modules,
 * programming with dependent types,
 * type systems for generic programming,
 * polytypic programming,
 * adaptive object-oriented programming,
 * component-based programming,
 * strategic programming,
 * aspect-oriented programming,
 * family polymorphism,
 * object-oriented generic programming,
 * implementation of generic programming languages,
 * static and dynamic analyses of generic programs,
 * and so on.

Submitted papers should fall into one of two categories:

 * Regular research papers (12 pages)
 * Short papers: case studies, tool demos, generic pearls (6 pages)

Regular research papers are expected to present novel and interesting
research results. Short papers need not present novel or fully polished
results. Good candidates for short papers are those that report on 
interesting case studies of generic programming in open source or 
industry, present demos of generic programming tools or libraries, 
or discuss elegant and illustrative uses of generic programming ('pearls').

All submissions should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (two-column, 9pt). Regular 
research papers must not exceed 12 pages. Short papers must not exceed 
6 pages. If applicable, papers should be marked with one of the labels
'case study, 'tool demo' or 'generic pearl' in the title at the time 
of submission.

Papers should be submitted via HotCRP at

Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS)
/************************************************************************************/

The ACM SIGPLAN conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery to make it the premier conference at the intersection of programming, languages, and software engineering. SPLASH is now accepting submissions. We invite high quality submissions describing original and unpublished work.


** OOPSLA Research Papers **
Papers that address any aspect of software development are welcome, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems. Papers may address these topics in a variety of ways, including new tools (such as languages, program analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and management techniques), and new evaluations (such as formalisms and proofs, corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).

Submissions Due: 25 March, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/oopsla2015


** Onward! Research Papers **
Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

Submissions Due: 2 April, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/onward2015-papers


** Onward! Essays **
Onward! Essays is looking for clear and compelling pieces of writing about topics important to the software community. An essay can be an exploration of a topic, its impact, or the circumstances of its creation; it can present a personal view of what is, explore a terrain, or lead the reader in an act of discovery; it can be a philosophical digression or a deep analysis. It can describe a personal journey, perhaps that by which the author reached an understanding of such a topic. The subject area should be interpreted broadly and can include the relationship of software to human endeavors, or its philosophical, sociological, psychological, historical, or anthropological underpinnings.

Submissions Due: 2 April, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/onward2015-essays


** Workshops **
The SPLASH Workshops track will host a variety of high-quality workshops, allowing their participants to meet and discuss research questions with peers, to mature new and exciting ideas, and to build up communities and start new collaborations. SPLASH workshops complement the main tracks of the conference and provide meetings in a smaller and more specialized setting. Workshops cultivate new ideas and concepts for the future, optionally recorded in formal proceedings.

Early Phase Submissions Due: 25 March, 2015
Late Phase Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-workshops


** Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) **
DLS is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to share knowledge and research on dynamic languages, their implementation, and applications. The influence of dynamic languages ? from Lisp to Smalltalk to Python to Javascript ? on real-world practice, and research, continues to grow. We invite high quality papers reporting original research, innovative contributions, or experience related to dynamic languages, their implementation, and applications.
