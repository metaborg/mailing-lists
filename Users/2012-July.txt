Hi Scott,

Apologies for the late reply. We've been busy with the name binding
language (NBL) lately.

I have the impression that both features should be expressible fairly
well with NBL. Perhaps you can send us (Gabriel, Guido; see cc) a
complete example?

NBL is now integrated as a separate DSL in Spoofax and is available in
the nightly build release. However, details are still somewhat in flux
and we haven't had time to write proper documentation yet.

cheers,

-- Eelco

Subject: [Stratego Users] integrating spoofax in another framework

Hey,

There's a framework we're developing at the Open University of Israel
called 'awesome' for integrating different domain-specific aspect langauges
(DSALs) (see http://www.cslab.openu.ac.il/research/awesome/).

The focus in 'awesome' framework is on the back-end - how to integrate the
DSALs after they're compiled to java form. I'm trying to improve the
existing front-end part using Spoofax - transforming the DSAL syntax to
java syntax using strategoxt tools.

With some help given by guys from the spoofax freenode channel, I've
managed to implement a transformation program for 'cool' DSAL, which seems
to be very good, even better then the current 'cool' front-end.

Now I'm trying to integrate the resulting front-end which is Spoofax based
into the awesome framework and I'm having the following problem:

I'm using jsglr to convert the 'cool' source file to AST, then run my
transformation program that produce a modified AST in 'java' syntax.
afterwards I need to produce a java source file from the modified AST -
in linux I've used pp-java, but it's not cross-platform thus it's not
possible to integrate it in awesome's eclipse project.
in spoofax project I include libjava-from and then perform
<pp-java5-to-string> to produce the java source file, but I can't use it
outside of spoofax project environment.

Basically what I do is:
a. create the transformation in spoofax project (transform.str)
b. compile the transformation to java (java -Xmx1024m -Xss8m -jar
c:\temp\strategoxt.jar -I ..\ -i transform.str)
c. compile the transformation in java form (javac -cp
c:\temp\strategoxt.jar transform.java)

in stage 'c' I'm getting the following error:
transform.java:5532: error: package pp_java5_to_string_0_0 does not exist
        term = pp_java5_to_string_0_0.instance.invoke(context, term);

I didn't managed to figure out how it's work on spoofax project, maybe
someone can guide me how to use the java-front library from the
command-line in the same way it's used in spoofax project.

Thanks,

You've done a really impressive job with stratego and spoofax!

Subject: [Stratego Users] compiling pretty printer for aspectj in java
Message-ID: <CAJdsiAPhen9cAv3KuG+MvfKXyE=pkTxdh6W3RU7=7TzhYxsGrA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

Thanks for helping me with my previous issue, I need some help with another
one.

I need to pretty print an AST that is produced with my translation program.
the AST is in aspectj syntax (using aspectj-front of course).
the default pretty print table that is produced from the aspectj syntax
doesn't include the standard formatting, so the code results in something
like:
public aspect Test {
                                 pointcut
                                 (
                                 )
                                 :
                                 call
...
                                }

of course that when I added horizontal formatting to the PointcutDec term
it fixed that, but there're too many terms to fix them manually.

I saw that there is an inner part in the aspectj-front package for pretty
print, and I've been told that it shouldn't be difficult to compile it to
java library so that I could use <pp-aspectj-string> from my transformation
program.
so I tried to compile the pretty-print.str using the java stratego compiler
as I compile my transformation program, but it seems that it doesn't
support the layout syntax (rule "Process() -> box |[  ... ]|" resulted in
an error: syntax error near unexpected character '|'..).
I guess that it caused by something similar to my previous question -
something that I'm not including in my compilation, but I can't find it for
couple of days already.

I'll appreciate any help with this.

Regards,
Arik

                         SoTeSoLa 2012
Summer School on Software Technologies and Software Languages

The summer school SoTeSoLa 2012 is a highly discussion- and
result-oriented Research 2.0 event on software technologies and
software languages.

http://planet-sl.org/sotesola2012

SoTeSoLa 2012 takes place in Koblenz 19-23 August 2012.

SoTeSoLa brings together senior and junior researchers and
technologists interested in software science, specifically the
foundations of software technologies and the notion of technological
spaces as linking together software languages, technologies, and
various resources adding up to a technological and community context.
SoTeSoLa also hosts this time the SATToSE 2012 seminar on "Advanced
Techniques & Tools for Software Evolution".

Key topics at the school are these:

- Generic language technology
- Co-evolution of software artifacts
- Multi-language, multi-technology problems
- Research 2.0 applied to software engineering
- Technological spaces: past, present, and future
- eLearning for language engineers & technologists
- Models of knowledge resources for software developers
- Model-driven engineering beyond software development
- Software re/reverse/engineering in the Semantic Web Era

SoTeSoLa aims at exercising a new format for a software
language/technology forum, i.e., a more Research 2.0-based approach so
that much focus is on understanding each others context, integrating
knowledge, automation thereof, and organizing future research and work
of the participants. To this end, regular lectures are de-emphasized,
but a more discussion- and result-oriented format will be exercised.

The event maxes out at 42 participants.

SoTeSoLa 2012 is supported by the ADAPT research focus at the
University of Koblenz-Landau as part of Rhineland Palatinate's
Research Initiative 2008--2013. SoTeSoLa 2012 is also supported by
RainCode. SoTeSoLa is hosted by the Software Languages Team in
Koblenz.

Deadlines:

- Registration deadline: 4 August 2012
- Hotel reservation deadline: 1 August 2012
- Deadline for SATToSE presentation proposals: 25 July 2012
- Deadline for student grant applications: 25 July 2012
- Deadline for hackathon and working-group proposals: none and ASAP
- Notification for SATToSE presentation proposals: 29 July 2012
- Summer school: 19 August (afternoon) - 23 August 2012 (noon)

Hi Arik,

Looks like you need to declare the concrete syntax of the box language
in the '.meta' file. For an example, look at the pretty-printer of
Java-Front:

https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/java-front/trunk/lib/java/pp/

e.g.

https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/java-front/trunk/lib/java/pp/expression.str

has

https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/java-front/trunk/lib/java/pp/expression.meta

cheers,

-- Eelco

Hi,

is it possible that you'll generate a java library that let us pretty print
aspectj AST such as you did for java (in java-front) ?
I've added a '.meta' file but then I'm getting an error that Stratego-Box
syntax can't be found after I tried all the possibilities I could think of
to include stratego-gpp library (-la stratego-gpp, -la
org.strategoxt.stratego_gpp, in linux: -la /usr/lib/libstratego-gpp and -la
/usr/lib/libstratego-gpp.la) ?

Thanks,

Arik

Hi Cristiano,

I don't think there is such a tool that you can apply. (I've made
similar tools in the past, but can't locate exactly this one.)
However, combining pack-sdf with a simple analysis to gather
productions for the same non-terminal and a pretty-printer to HTML
should make a fine SDF-to-HTML transformation. We'll be happy to
include it in the toolset.

cheers,

Subject: [Stratego Users] Question concerning UnexpectedClassException by
 invoking an external strategy
Message-ID: <20120731105854.80050@gmx.net>

Hello,

at the moment, I try to implement a external java strategy for spoofax that 
should be invoked by a custom disambiguation rule. The purpose of the 
external strategy is to?gather some kind of required information from an 
given UML model. During the invocation of the external java strategy an 
UnexpectedClassException is thrown. The concerning class is a part of the 
eclipse uml2 plug-in?that it is registered?in?the?'required plug-ins' 
section of my project configuration.

In my opinion, a java strategy is not invoked in?the same?environment 
context as it is used for Eclipse. Now my question is, how it is possible 
to configure the classpath in such a way so that the required uml2 package 
is usable within a external java strategy.

Best regards,
Alexander

Hi Alexander,

I believe there are two solutions.

The first one is to find the .jar's that you depend on, add these to your
classpath, and also add providers for them in yourLanguage-Builers.esv.
Spoofax will then dynamically load the classes when you build your editor.
However, if the framework you're depending on is big, you'll end up adding
a whole bunch of .jar's to your classpath and things will get messy. If the
classes you're using (from UML2) have dependencies to other frameworks
(e.g. EMF), you'll end up having to add .jar's from those frameworks as
well, etc.

A better solution in that case is probably to add UML2 as a dependency
('required plug-ins'), just like you did. But then you can't dynamically
load your editor anymore and you'll have to start working with two Eclipse
instances: a development instance and a runtime instance.
In that case, you also have to make sure that you're using the Spoofax
Nightly and that your MANIFEST.MF contains the following line:
*Eclipse-RegisterBuddy:
org.strategoxt.imp.runtime*
This has only recently been added to Spoofax.

Regards,
Oskar

Dear Oskar,

thank you for the quick feedback! I have taken your second approach and it works perfect.

Best regards,
Alexander
