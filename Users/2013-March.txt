Subject: [Stratego Users] Stratego write to file
Message-ID: <CACLuXbKdWXNVCgs0UzFZZDFvMXMTF4cYFj=K1OkD3WCyurmiAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I want to write to a file in Stratego.

I use following commands. It writes to file but it also writes quotation
marks and escape characters \ . (which I highlighted with red) . What
should I do to write strings only between quotation marks and without
escape characters?

 fd := <fopen> (".project", "w");
 projectContent := *"*<?xml version=*\*"1.0*\*" encoding=*\*"UTF-8*\*"?>
<projectDescription>
<name>MyProject</name>
<comment></comment>
<projects>
</projects>
<buildSpec>
<buildCommand>
<name>org.eclipse.jdt.core.javabuilder</name>
<arguments>
</arguments>
</buildCommand>
</buildSpec>
<natures>
<nature>org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature</nature>
</natures>
</projectDescription>
*"*;
  <WriteToTextFile> ("test\\.project", projectContent);
<fclose> (fd)

Thanks for your help,
Hilal

Hey Hilal,

It should not write quotation marks and escapes to the file.. anyway, you
can try out string formatting like so:
 projectContent := $[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <projectDescription>
<name>MyProject</name>
 <comment></comment>
 <projects>
</projects>
 <buildSpec>
 <buildCommand>
<name>org.eclipse.jdt.core.javabuilder</name>
 <arguments>
</arguments>
 </buildCommand>
 </buildSpec>
<natures>
 <nature>org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature</nature>
 </natures>
</projectDescription>
]

You can escape back to stratego by nesting []'s, for example to fill in the
project name: <name>[strategoVarWithName]</name>

Some more info about string formatting:

Cheers,
Gabri?l

changed. I got the following output when I try your suggestion. The output
below contains \n expressions which I don't want to see.

Hi Hilal.

You can find documentation on file access here: http://releases.strategoxt.org/docs/api/libstratego-lib/stable/docs/html/system/io/file.html

Typically, you apply the following strategies:

1. <fopen> (filename, "w") opens a file for writing and gives you a file descriptor of the open file.
2. <fputs> (content, filedescriptor) writes to a file.
3. <fclose> filedescriptor closes a file.

HTH, Guido

You can escape back to stratego by nesting []'s, for example to fill in the
project name: <name>[strategoVarWithName]</name>

Some more info about string formatting:

Hello,

Yes, it is probably because of using WriteToTextFile. WriteToTextFile
uses write-in-text-to-stream strategy to write to file. I tried
<WriteToFile(s)> with all strategies (write-in-baf-to-stream,
write-in-taf-to-stream, write-in-text-to-stream) but the result didn't
change. It still writes all the quotation marks and other things. Is
there any other writer strategy I miss?

I appreciate your help,
Hilal

Hi Hilal,
It might be easiest to use the approach Guido replied with Hi Hilal.
You can find documentation on file access here: http://releases.strategoxt.org/docs/api/libstratego-lib/stable/docs/html/system/io/file.html
Typically, you apply the following strategies:
1. <fopen> (filename, "w") opens a file for writing and gives you a file descriptor of the open file.
2. <fputs> (content, filedescriptor) writes to a file.
3. <fclose> filedescriptor closes a file.

Hi,

I have a list like below and I want to convert it to a string.

["a","b","c"] => "abc"

I try to concat all elements in the list like below but it fails.

a := "";
<map(a := <conc-strings>(a, <id>))>myList;
<debug> a;

How can I do this?
Thank you,
Hilal

Yeh,

Hilal, conc-strings is to concatenate tuples of strings. Just like conc
concatenates tuples of lists and concat lists of lists.

Cheers,
Andre

Subject: [Stratego Users] ppgen and context-free priorities
Message-ID: <BAY175-DS186AF1D4F0FCA33CBB53A9D0E70@phx.gbl>

Hi,

 

I have an sdf file of some 100+ productions, some significant portions of
which are in "context-free priorities".

My problem is that ppgen seemingly discards rules outside of "[.] syntax"
blocks. Is this by design? Should having non-chain rules, ie. not in the
simplest form S1 -> S2, be considered bad practice?

 

Thanks !

There has always been some ambiguity about the treatment of
productions in priority sections. In SDF1 productions should be
redundantly specified in a syntax section and priorities section. In
SDF2 productions are derived from priorities sections, but this
feature was not well known. Tools that take non-normalized SDF2 as
input (which is probably what ppgen does) do not take the effort to
repeat the normalization.

> Should having non-chain rules, ie. not in the simplest form S1 -> S2, be considered bad practice?

The answer is obviously no. A grammar with only chain rules is clearly
useless. But perhaps I misunderstand your question.

Thanks for the clarification. This problem affects not just the command-line distribution but Spoofax too. I will report it on Yellowgrass. 
Meanwhile - is there an appropriate tool that normalizes SDF2 and that could be included in the build.xml?

I wanted to ask question regarding only the context-free priorities section. I thought that maybe - without introducing redundancies in the sdf file - the appropriate way would be to write something like:
context-free syntax
  Expr "*" Expr -> MulOp { cons("Mul") }
  Expr "+" Expr -> AddOp { cons("Add") }

context-free priorities
    MulOp -> Expr
  > AddOp -> Expr

instead of repeating the complete rules.

The problem with that approach is that there might be multiple productions
of the same sort. The multiply/addition definitions might look different in
another language definition:

context-free syntax
  Expr "*" Expr -> Expr { cons("Mul") }
  Expr "+" Expr -> Expr { cons("Add") }

With these productions, it is not possible to identify which SDF production
is targeted in the c-f priorities when the SDF sort (Expr in this example)
is used.
A better suggestion would be to be able to use the constructor names (Muland
Add) in the c-f priorities. On the other hand, having the productions
redundantly defined in the c-f priorities makes the c-f priorities more
informative without the need to lookup the productions elsewhere in the
file(s).

Hi all,

there is indeed a redundant-free way to specify priorities, which is currently implemented in the Template Language, but not in SDF itself:

context-free syntax

	Exp "+" Exp -> Exp {"Add"}
	Exp "*" Exp -> Exp {"Mul"}

context-free priorities

	Exp.Mul > Exp.Add

Subject: [Stratego Users] First Workshop on Domain Specific Languages Design
	and Implementation (DSLDI)
Message-ID: <CAFaCHU1CKkBj2+6-Pv7gNEcBV5DV+J3n9FT5MZnagBJE2tL2kA@mail.gmail.com>

First Workshop on Domain Specific Languages Design and Implementation (DSLDI)


Modern hardware is growing more and more complex, often featuring not
only multiple cores but also heterogeneous components with various
types of architecturally different accelerators. Consequently, it is
increasingly more difficult for the programmers to produce
high-performance scalable software, which is often equally complex,
using general-purpose programming languages such as Java or C++, as
they lack appropriate language-level abstractions. Languages designed
to support high productivity, such as scripting languages exemplified
by Python, JavaScript or Perl, make the programmer's task much
easier. Their performance, however, while certainly adequate for some
use cases, is not quite on-par with that of the general-purpose
programming languages. Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) combine the
best features of the general-purpose programming languages, that is
efficiency, and of the languages designed for high productivity, that
is ease of programming. This makes DSLs our best hope for harnessing
computational resources available on modern architectures without
requiring super-human programming skills.

The goal of the DSLDI workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners interested in sharing ideas on how Domain Specific
Languages should be designed and implemented and on usage scenarios
for modern DSLs. We are interested both in discovering how already
known domains, such as graph processing or machine learning, can be
best supported by DSLs but also in exploring new domains that could be
targeted by DSLs. More generally, we are interested in building a
community that can drive forward development of modern DSLs.

The workshop will consist of a series of short invited talks whose
main goal would be to trigger exchange of opinion and discussions on
the topics within DSLDI's area of interest which include but are not
limited to the following ones:

- DSL implementation techniques, including compiler-level and
  runtime-level solutions
- utilization of domain knowledge for driving optimizations of DSL
  implementations
- utilizing DSLs for managing parallelism and hardware heterogeneity
- DSL performance and scalability studies
- DSL tools, such as DSL editors and editor plugins, debuggers,
  refactoring tools, etc.
- applications of DSLs to existing as well as emerging domains, for
  example graph processing, image processing, machine learning,
  analytics, robotics, etc.
- practitioners reports, for example descriptions of DSL deployment in
  a real-life production setting

The workshop will be informal and will not have proceedings of any
kind.  We have a limited number of presentation slots so we welcome
suggestions for people to give talks about their experience of using
or developing DSLs.  If you would like to give a presentation then
please contact Adam Welc at adam.welc at oracle.com (presentation
submission deadline: April 26th, 2013).

Subject: [Stratego Users] Empty lists parse ambiguously
Message-ID: <BAY002-W51E345BBCB9E3B80984971D0E20@phx.gbl>

Hi,
Some of the star iterations in my grammar parse ambiguously, such that empty occurrences produce both [] and "" or [""].

e.g. for the following rule:

Atom "(" { Expr "," }* ")" ClauseGuard? "->" { Expr "," }+ -> FunctionClause { cons("FunctionClause") }

(and for the text f()->a)

sglri produces the following:

[ amb(
   [ FunctionClause(Atom("f"), [], None(), [Atom("a")])
   , FunctionClause(Atom("f"), "", None(), [Atom("a")])
  ]
 )
]

JSGLR produces something very similar:

[ amb(
   [ FunctionClause(Atom("f"), [], None(), [Atom("a")])
   , FunctionClause(Atom("f"), [""], None(), [Atom("a")])
  ]
 )
]

Expr does not produce "".
 
A rule of possible interest may be the following:
Expr Expr -> Expr { cons("OpCons"), right, prefer } (but I doubt that this would cause the problem)

As far as I'm concerned the "lexer" does not accept "" as any token, not even LAYOUT.

sglr reports 0 ambiguities. sglri --heuristic-filters on also produces a correct, unambiguous AST.

What should be the correct step to take? My best bet is to use a disambiguator rule in the language definition, but surely, that's not too elegant.

Thanks for the hints in advance!

Hi, 

Great, thanks!
Is there a quite-stable version of the Template Language somewhere
available, perhaps integrated with Spoofax?

Subject: [Stratego Users] Unimploded parse table with JSGLR?
Message-ID: <BAY175-DS646E34B07D16B1A1CDC13D0E20@phx.gbl>

Hi all,

 

I'm trying to do source-to-source transformations on Erlang programs using
Spoofax, but some users would need a self-contained executable - thus most
of the code must compile and run with the native tools. 

 

I would like to preserve as much of the formatting as possible. For this, I
would need an unimploded parse tree (or an only partially imploded, layout
and tokens intact). After perusing the APIs, I have found the
libstratego-sglr/parse-file-pt strategy to be appropriate. It produces the
correct output in native; however, JSGLR outputs an imploded tree. I have
traced this through STRSGLR_parse_string_pt.java to Asfix2TreeBuilder - with
little success. I did not find any traces of the classic "implode-asfix"
step's substeps (namely the removal of lit and layout nodes).

 

Is my approach to the problem correct? Does a solution exist?

 

Thanks in advance

 

-- Barnab?s

Yes, the Template Language is supported in Spoofax 1.1.

============================================================================
  Workshop on Domain Specific Languages Design and Implementation (DSLDI)

                         Collocated with ECOOP 2013

                Monday, July 1st, 2013, Montpellier, France

                      http://dsldi2013.hyperdsls.org/
============================================================================


Modern hardware is growing more and more complex, often featuring not only
multiple cores but also heterogeneous components with various types of
architecturally different accelerators. Consequently, it is increasingly more
difficult for the programmers to produce high-performance scalable software,
which is often equally complex, using general-purpose programming languages
such as Java or C++, as they lack appropriate language-level abstractions.
Languages designed to support high productivity, such as scripting languages
exemplified by Python, JavaScript or Perl, make the programmer's task much
easier. Their performance, however, while certainly adequate for some use
cases, is not quite on-par with that of the general-purpose programming
languages. Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) combine the best features of the
general-purpose programming languages, that is efficiency, and of the
languages designed for high productivity, that is ease of programming. This
makes DSLs our best hope for harnessing computational resources available on
modern architectures without requiring super-human programming skills.

The goal of the DSLDI workshop is to bring together researchers and
practitioners interested in sharing ideas on how Domain Specific Languages
should be designed and implemented and on usage scenarios for modern DSLs. We
are interested both in discovering how already known domains, such as graph
processing or machine learning, can be best supported by DSLs but also in
exploring new domains that could be targeted by DSLs. More generally, we are
interested in building a community that can drive forward development of
modern DSLs.

The workshop will consist of a series of short invited talks whose main goal
would be to trigger exchange of opinion and discussions on the topics within
DSLDI's area of interest which include but are not limited to the following:

- DSL implementation techniques, including compiler-level and
  runtime-level solutions
- utilization of domain knowledge for driving optimizations of DSL
  implementations
- utilizing DSLs for managing parallelism and hardware heterogeneity
- DSL performance and scalability studies
- DSL tools, such as DSL editors and editor plugins, debuggers,
  refactoring tools, etc.
- applications of DSLs to existing as well as emerging domains, for
  example graph processing, image processing, machine learning,
  analytics, robotics, etc.
- practitioners reports, for example descriptions of DSL deployment in
  a real-life production setting

The workshop will be informal and will not have proceedings of any kind.  We
have a limited number of presentation slots so we welcome suggestions for
people to give talks about their experience of using or developing DSLs.  If
you would like to give a presentation then please contact Adam Welc at
adam.welc at oracle.com (presentation submission deadline: April 26th, 2013).

/Self-reconfigurable modular robots are mechatronic devices that have 
the capability//
//to modify their own shape. They have a promising potential as a result 
of being able to//
//solve a wider range of problems. However, programming 
self-reconfigurable robots is//
//in general a difficult task. General-purpose languages like ANSI-C or 
Java provide only//

//unreliable hardware, and dynamically evolving communication topology. 
We believe//
//that a domain-specific language is needed to be able to program robot 
behavior on//
//a higher, more productive level. Existing DSLs and control approaches 
have been//
//developed in the past, but were designed to solve problems specific to 
certain scenarios.//
//In this work, a domain analysis is used to identify and define 
concepts in existing//
//approaches. Based on this, a prototype for a new DSL is implemented in

//workbench Spoofax. The prototype is called MetaForma and comprises a 
compiler with//

acts as an abstrac-//

I want to define a DSL for specifying a concept model, and try to come up with name bindings.
A fragment of what I would like to be able to specify is the following:

    Concept Person {
	  Attribute name: String,
        Attribute address : Address (inverse of inhabitant)
    }

    Concept Address {
        Attribute inhabitant : list of Person (inverse of address)
    }

Thus here we have two concepts (possibly each in a separate file) and each concept has an attribute which can be the inverse of the attribute of the other concept.

The grammar fragment for this that I came up is the following:

    "Concept" ID "{" Attributen  "}"    -> Concept {cons("Concept")}
  

    {Attribuut ","}*                    -> Attributen {cons("Attributes")}
    
    
    "Attribuut" ID ":" Type {AttributeProps}?   -> Attribuut {cons("Attribute")}
        
    ID                  -> Type {cons("Type")}
    "list of" ID        -> Type {cons("ListType")}

    "(" AttributeProperty ","}+ ")" -> AttributetProps {cons("Relation")}

    "association"            -> AttributeProperty {cons("Association")}
    "aggregation"            -> AttributeProperty {cons("Aggregation")}
    "inverse of" ID          -> AttributeProperty {cons("Inverse")}


I tried some namebinding rules, but cannot think of what to specify for the Inverse(a) constructor.
What I's like is that the content assist will list all attributes of the type of the attribute.

So the rule for Inverse should somehow look up the attribute definition in which it occurs and import the attributes of the type there.

I tried something like   
	Attribute(a, t, r) :
		defines unique Attribute a of type t
		imports Attribute from Concept t in r

	Inverse(a) :
           refers to Attribute ...
	 
so that at least the attributes of t should be in scope, but that doesn?t seem to work. I get a somewhat cryptic message:

Hi Gert, 

in which version of Spoofax are you getting this error? 

The code you showed should work, but there are some complicated cases which are currently not handled and you might came up with such a case.

But what you like to achieve can be done in a simpler way:

	Concept(c, a*) : 
		defines unique Concept c 
		scopes Attribute

	Attribute(a, t, r) : 
		defines unique Attribute a of type t

	Inverse(a): 
		refers to Attribute a

The important part is the scope, since concepts restrict the visibility of attributes. In the more complicated case, you want to refer to an attribute in the type of the attribute:

	Attribute(a, Type(t), [?, Inverse(i), ?]):
		defines unique Attribute a of type Type(t)
		refers to Attribute i in Concept t
	
	Attribute(a, ListType(t), [?, Inverse(i), ?]):
		defines unique Attribute a of type ListType(t)
		refers to Attribute i in Concept t

However, the list match [?, x, ?] in this pattern is currently not supported. We currently work on a new version of NaBL, which is more reliable than the current prototype and much more flexible which allows to handle also complicated cases.

On a second view, I found a possible reason for the error:

> 	Attribute(a, t, r) :
> 		defines unique Attribute a of type t
> 		imports Attribute from Concept t in r

Here, t is not a name, it is a term Type(?) or ListType(?). That is, why it will not be resolved and the import does not work. Try

	Attribute(a, Type(t), r) :
		defines unique Attribute a of type Type(t)
		imports Attribute from Concept t in r

Subject: [Stratego Users] trouble building "classic" strategoxt-0.17 from
	source
Message-ID: <507C8D85-69CE-49F1-B0B4-782747563675@rice.edu>

Hi,

I apologize for asking for help with an old pre-Spoofax system but I as described in an earlier email to the list, our project is C++ based and we'd prefer not to include Java code if we don't have to.

I'm trying to build StrategoXT 0.17 and its prerequisites from source code on an amd64 linux box running CentOS 5.5. I have downloaded and untar'd aterm-2.5 (and applied the patch), sdf2-bundle-2.4, and strategoxt-0.17 from tinyurl.com/cmgw4po. Now I'm trying to follow the installation instructions at tinyurl.com/cw4h6ww.

Here's my configure/build script, which I run from a top level directory containing these three source trees and with XXX replaced by an absolute path to my desired installation directory:

install=XXX

pushd aterm-2.5
./configure --prefix=$install/aterm
make install
popd

pushd sdf2-bundle-2.4
./configure --prefix=$install/sdf --with-aterm=$install/aterm
make install
popd

pushd strategoxt-0.17
./configure --prefix=$install/stratego --with-aterm=$install/aterm --with-sdf=$install/sdf
make install
popd

When I run this, aterm-2.5 and sdf2-bundle-2.4 build correctly and strategoxt-0.17 builds quite a bit of stuff before failing as follows while trying to make stratego-libraries/sglr/lib:

...
make[3]: Entering directory `/home/scott/rosebud/infrastructure/strategoxt-0.17/stratego-libraries/sglr/lib'

make[3]: *** [stratego-sglr.rtree] Error 127
make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/scott/rosebud/infrastructure/strategoxt-0.17/stratego-libraries/sglr/lib'
...

The proximate cause is that the repository specified for $XTC_REPOSITORY does not exist:

$ ls /home/scott/rosebud/infrastructure/strategoxt-0.17/BUILDTIME_XTC
ls: /home/scott/rosebud/infrastructure/strategoxt-0.17/BUILDTIME_XTC: No such file or directory

I'm not passing configure a '--with-repository' argument because according to chapter 5.2 of the Stratego/XT Manual at tinyurl.com/ccm4qrw I should not need a "baseline":

"Bootstrapping using the baseline is only necessary for developers of Stratego/XT itself. Normal users of Stratego/XT receive tarballs which do not need a baseline: they contain all generated and bootstrapped sources."

Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong or suggest an approach for me to debug this?

Thanks,

Hi Guido,

Thanks for the quick response. Im using the nightly build, version 1.1.0.0-r26027.
I tried your fix with the Attribute(a, Type(t), r) but to no avail.
The error disappears when I remove the clause "imports Attribute from Concept t in r"
But then of course I get errors telling me it cannot resolve.
I'd indeed like to get it so that the inverse can only be selected from the type of the attribute.
So, ultimately, I'd have to wait for the new version of NBL.
Meanwhile I'll try some rewiring of the grammar to avoid needing a list match.

Thanks

Gert

Hi Gert, 

in which version of Spoofax are you getting this error? 

The code you showed should work, but there are some complicated cases which are currently not handled and you might came up with such a case.

But what you like to achieve can be done in a simpler way:

	Concept(c, a*) : 
		defines unique Concept c 
		scopes Attribute

	Attribute(a, t, r) : 
		defines unique Attribute a of type t

	Inverse(a): 
		refers to Attribute a

The important part is the scope, since concepts restrict the visibility of attributes. In the more complicated case, you want to refer to an attribute in the type of the attribute:

	Attribute(a, Type(t), [..., Inverse(i), ...]):
		defines unique Attribute a of type Type(t)
		refers to Attribute i in Concept t
	
	Attribute(a, ListType(t), [..., Inverse(i), ...]):
		defines unique Attribute a of type ListType(t)
		refers to Attribute i in Concept t

However, the list match [..., x, ...] in this pattern is currently not supported. We currently work on a new version of NaBL, which is more reliable than the current prototype and much more flexible which allows to handle also complicated cases.

Not sure if this will help, but the manual states to first run 'make'
before running 'make install'. Perhaps this is the issue?

Thanks for the input, but that's not it -- I've tried it your way, and anyway for autoconf makefiles 'all' is a prerequisite to 'install', so 'make install' is equivalent to 'make; make install'.

Do you have slgri anywhere in your build or install directories?

Crazy idea: try building all the packages with the same --prefix, instead of 
splitting them into multiple directories.

Not sure if it actually uses this, so it may not matter.

If those files are missing:
stratego-libraries/sglr/lib/libstratego-sglr.rtree
stratego-libraries/sglr/lib/libstratego-sglr.c

Then try to unpack the tarball again. "make clean" will remove it
because they were strangely put in CLEANFILES instead of
MAINTAINERCLEANFILES.

If they are here then the time of files got wrong when you unpacked.
To fix it, you can try:

find stratego-libraries/sglr/lib -name "*.str" -exec touch {} ";"

David, thanks for the tip -- the files you mention were in fact missing from my source tree, no doubt because I've done 'make clean' many times. So I fetched them back out of the tarball, touched all the "*.str" files as you suggested, and tried again. Unfortunately I still get the same failure.

From reading the relevant "configure.ac" files it seems to me that when no baseline repository is specified, the configure script will choose an incorrect order for building subpackages. In file "strategoxt-0.17/configure.ac" starting at line 116 is the following code:

### CONFIGURATION OF STRATEGOXT PACKAGES ##########################

  PKGS="autoxt xtc $BPKGS stratego-libraries"
  LIBARGS="--enable-baseline"
else

When no baseline is specified, the 'else' branch is taken and $PKGS is set so as to build "stratego-libraries" BEFORE "asfix-tools". However, my build error message shows that during the build of "stratego-libraries" the makefile tries to run "asfix-tools/xtc/sglri", which hasn't been built yet!

I can't see how this configure code can work, but I also can't imagine how a bug like this could go undetected for so long. Before I dive in and fiddle around with the configure script I'd like to hear from someone familiar with how this works.

Anyone?

To compile packages from PKGS, you need stratego-libraries compiled
from the C files. But the C files from stratego-libraries are
generated from .str file using tools from PKGS. The C files are not on
the repository, and to bootstrap you need a baseline. In that case you
need to build first the packages from PKGS. But in that case the build
will use stratego-libraries from the installed baseline and not the
one from the source repository, because it has to be built after.

However, the C files are "dist" files in the tarball. The reason is
that they are not declared in a "nodist_" Automake variable (source
files are implicitly in the dist in Automake). In that case you can
just compile them before PKGS. So stratego-libraries is listed before
PKGS.

This is why it works. But the "make clean" is a bug. What is in the
distribution should not be in the CLEANFILES.

Here is a question I forgot to answer because it got filtered. But
maybe someone one day will need the answer.

The answer is no. Transformers was made using StrategoXT "classic
edition". To make Transformers work on Spoofax, one would need to
re-implement the C native functions of Tranformers. It is just few
things that were not in the Stratego language that we needed for
efficiency. There is an extension to introduce references in Stratego,
another is for lazy evaluation, and the last one is just a destructor
callback from the garbage collector to deal properly with shared
scoped symbol tables. They should be quite easy to reimplement in
Java.

Then after there are lots of Makefiles, because there is a LOT to
generate. The workflow used with SDF grammars is slightly different
from the typical StrategoXT workflow. We have our own extensions of
SDF and our own parsing tools for them. I am not sure how Eclipse
deals with complex building rule dependencies, but I would discourage
trying to build everything by "hand".

Message-ID: <CAFaCHU2R2zg63qqEdBABKM53+s7PksH08dNpTrKsqDSRBLoYDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We are happy to announce the release of Spoofax 1.1! This is the first
major release since version 1.0.1 and includes major features and
improvements. Spoofax 1.1 supports all current Eclipse versions, up to
version 4.2.2.

You can update your Eclipse from http://download.spoofax.org/update/stable

Full download instructions are available at
http://metaborg.org/wiki/spoofax/download

One of the most important improvements in Spoofax 1.1 is the inclusion
of NaBL, the Spoofax Name Binding Language. NaBL is used in all new
projects created and significantly simplifies name binding analysis,
as well as any editor services that depend on it (e.g., code
completion, reference resolving)

NaBL is documented at the following pages:

- Tutorial http://metaborg.org/wiki/nabl
- Examples http://metaborg.org/wiki/nabl/examples
- Research paper http://researchr.org/publication/KonatKWV13

Other highlights of the 1.1 release include:

- Improved build process: generated files can be deleted, building &
loading are separated, projects can be cleaned
(http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/577,
http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/591,
http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/578)
- Improved Stratego editor with multi-file reference resolving based
on NaBL (http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/12)
- Extended support for customizing refactoring UI
(http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/440)
- Automatic configuration of git/svn ignore settings
(http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/573)
- Added support loading for Java-based plugin dependencies, in case
your plugin depends on some other plugin such as EMF
(http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/322)

And there were a number of notable changes under the hood:

- Much improved completion engine (http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/360)
- We now show a nice warning if Eclipse is not configured with a
proper stack and heap size (http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/86)
- Files are now queued for re-analysis even if their editor is not
open (http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/224)

A comprehensive list of changes can be viewed at
http://yellowgrass.org/tag/Spoofax/1.1.

This message also appears in our new blog:

Hi Eelco

Just tried a fresh install and got error below on creating a new 
project.  Tried a clean - which reported success - but doesn't build 
properly on subsequent edit/save of sdf file.

Any suggestions?  Config is:

  - |spoofax 1.1.0.0-r25945||(||http://spoofax.org/update/stable|)
  - eclipse-SDK-4.2.2-linux-gtk-x86_64
- OpenJDK 1.7.0_09 (64-Bit Server VM)
  - Linux Mint 14 (64 bit)

Occurred when I created a new spoofax project.  Selected 'generate 
.gitignore', didn't select 'generate minimal project only'.

Thanks,
Scott.

David and everyone,

I still can't build strategoxt-0.17 from source. I understand generally how bootstrapping with a baseline is supposed to work, but so far I haven't managed to grasp the details of the build system code which implement it, and so haven't been able to solve the problem by myself through debugging.

(1) Doesn't the following documentation excerpt say that I should not need a baseline in order to build strategoxt-0.17 from source? It seems to.

Chapter 5.2 of the Stratego/XT Manual at tinyurl.com/ccm4qrw:

"Bootstrapping using the baseline is only necessary for developers of Stratego/XT itself. Normal users of Stratego/XT receive tarballs which do not need a baseline: they contain all generated and bootstrapped sources."

I assume that the tarball offered on the Stratego/XT Download page is such a "normal-user" one and that it can be built without a baseline. And indeed the C files which come from bootstrapping *are* present in this tarball.

Specifically, my directory "asfix-tools/xtc" does contain the source file "sglri.c" presumably obtained by compiling "sglri.str". But the package build order chosen at configure time tries to run an sglri executable from "asfix-tools/xtc" *before* that C file has been compiled into an executable.

Thus my best effort at following the instructions at tinyurl.com/cw4h6ww still results in build-time errors, as described in my post of March 21, 2013. Is there a missing option or step or something that would make this work?

(2) If I'm wrong about Chapter 5.2 and I do in fact need a baseline, where would I get one?

Sorry if I'm dense but I could really use a hint.

skw

Hi Scott,

Yes, the Stratego/XT _tarball_ should be self-buildable. But where did you
get a tarball? I note that the source links on
http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/StrategoDownload are not reachable. A
checkout from the svn repository is not the same as a tarball. What 5.2
explains is that by having a baseline it is not necessary to store the
generated C files in the version repository. But since you have the sglri.c
file, you seem to have a baseline tarball.

The baseline _is_ the 0.17 tarball.

Hi Eelco,

Thanks for confirming that the 0.17 tarball should be self-buildable. I downloaded my tar files from the StrategoDownload link that you mentioned. I just checked it and you're right, those links are currently not reachable, but they were when I downloaded my copies. Will these links be restored to working order again? I understood that it was planned to continue distributing the 0.17 release?

In any case: I do have a baseline tarball in my possession, but I can't get it to build by following the instructions. I assume I'm doing something wrong -- can you guess what?

A checkout from the svn repository is not the same as a tarball. What 5.2 explains is that by having a baseline it is not necessary to store the generated C files in the version repository. But since you have the sglri.c file, you seem to have a baseline tarball.

I have changed the URL's on that page now from ftp.stratego-language.org to
ftp.strategoxt.org, which solves the reachability issue as far as I can
see.

Cheers,
Rob

Thanks!

I just realized that I caused this problem, as I recently migrated the
stratego-language.org domain to another registrar (and forgot to
configure DNS entries for subdomains).

Absolutely. And they are back online. A little mishap with DNS configuration.

Not off the top of my head. It has been a while. I'll try to build the
distribution myself next week.

Thanks, Eelco. I'll keep reading code and scratching my head, and if you have time to try building it yourself next week that would be great!

WRS 2013: CALL FOR PAPERS
-------------------------

11th International Workshop on
Reduction Strategies in Rewriting and Programming (WRS 2013)
http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/events/wrs2013/
27 June 2013, Eindhoven, the Netherlands

IMPORTANT DATES

* Paper submission deadline: 24 April 2013
* Notification of acceptance: 22 May 2013
* Preliminary proceedings version due: 5 June 2013
* Workshop: 27 June 2013
* Paper submission for final proceedings: TBA
* Notification of acceptance: TBA
* Final version due: TBA

AIMS AND SCOPE

The WRS workshop promotes research and collaboration in the area of
reduction strategies in rewriting and programming. It encourages the
presentation of new directions, developments, and results as well as
surveys and tutorials on existing knowledge in this area. Reduction
strategies define which (sub)expression(s) should be selected for
evaluation and which rule(s) should be applied. These choices affect
fundamental properties of computations such as laziness, strictness,
completeness, and efficiency, to name a few. For this reason programming
languages such as Elan, Maude, OBJ, Stratego, and TOM allow the explicit
definition of the evaluation strategy, whereas languages such as Clean,
Curry, and Haskell allow its modification. In addition to strategies
in rewriting and programming, WRS also covers the use of strategies
and tactics in other areas such as theorem and termination proving.

Previous editions of the workshop were held in Utrecht (2001),
Copenhagen (2002), Valencia (2003), Aachen (2004), Nara (2005),
Seattle (2006), Paris (2007), Hagenberg (2008), Brasilia (2009),
Edinburgh (2010), Novi Sad (2011), and Manchester (2012); the
2010 and 2012 editions were joint with the STRATEGIES workshop.
Further information can be found at the permanent site for WRS
(http://users.dsic.upv.es/~wrs/).

WRS 2013 will be co-located with RTA 2013 (24th International Conference
on Rewriting Techniques and Applications), as a satellite event of RDP,
the Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming.
WRS 2013 will be held on 27 June in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.

PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION

The submission process is in two stages.

* Before the workshop, authors are invited to submit an extended
? abstract (max. 5 pages) to be formatted in the EasyChair class style
? through the EasyChair submission site:

??? https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wrs2013

? Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included
? in the preliminary proceedings, available at the workshop.

* After the workshop, authors will be invited to submit a full paper
? of their presentation (typically a 15-pages paper), which will be
? refereed and considered for publication in an electronic journal,
? such as Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science.

Beyond original ideas and recent results not published nor submitted
elsewhere, we also invite authors to submit a 5-pages abstract
describing relevant work that has been or will be published elsewhere,
or work in progress. These submissions will be only considered for
presentation at the workshop and inclusion in the preliminary
proceedings but not in the final proceedings.

INVITED SPEAKER

* Eelco Visser, Delft Univerity of Technology, the Netherlands

PROGRAM COMMITTEE

* Sandra Alves, University of Porto
* Isabelle Gnaedig, LORIA and INRIA Nancy
* Bernhard Gramlich, Technische Universit?t Wien
* J?rgen Giesl, RWTH Aachen

Subject: [Stratego Users]  Refactorings as a transformation step
Message-ID: <BAY175-DS1435858BCC563EBD9268CCD0D30@phx.gbl>

Hi,

 

I'm trying to extend a tried language with some proprietary constructs. This
would practically mean automatically doing layout-preserving refactorings. 

 

What facilities are there to use?

 

Thanks

Barnab?s Kr?lik
