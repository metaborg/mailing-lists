========================================================================
JOURNAL OF APPLIED LOGIC
Special Issue on Automated Specification and Verification of Web Systems

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/tkutsia/jal-wwv.html
========================================================================

SCOPE
-----
This special issue of the Journal of Applied Logic is related
to the topics of the workshop WWV'10: Automated Specification
and Verification of Web Systems, which took place in Vienna on
July 30-31, 2010. Both participants of the workshop and other
authors are invited to submit contributions.

The increased complexity of Web sites and the explosive growth
of Web-based applications has turned their design and
construction into a challenging problem. Nowadays, many
companies have diverted their Web sites into interactive,
completely-automated, Web-based applications (such as Amazon,
on-line banking, or travel agencies) with a high complexity
that requires appropriate specification and verification
techniques and tools. Systematic, formal approaches to the
analysis and verification can address the problems of this
particular domain with automated and reliable tools that also
incorporate semantic aspects.

We solicit original papers on logic-based methods and
techniques applied to Web sites, Web services or Web-based
applications, such as:

  * Rule-based approaches to Web systems analysis, certification,
    specification, verification, and optimization
  * Algebraic methods for verification and certification of Web
    systems
  * Formal models for describing and reasoning about Web systems
  * Model-checking, synthesis and debugging of Web systems
  * Abstract interpretation and program transformation applied to
    the semantic Web
  * Intelligent tutoring and advisory systems for Web
    specifications authoring
  * Web quality and Web metrics
  * Web usability and accessibility
  * Testing and evaluation of Web systems and applications

SUBMISSION
----------
We expect original articles (typically 15-25 pages; submission
of larger papers will be evaluated depending on editorial
constraints) that present high-quality contributions that have
not been previously published and that must not be
simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere.

Submissions must comply with JAL's author guidelines. They must
be written in English and should be prepared using the Elsevier
LaTeX package.

Submissions are encouraged via the EasyChair submission system:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jalwwv2010.

IMPORTANT DATES
---------------
  * Submission of papers: March 7, 2011.
  * Notification: June 6, 2011.

           10th International Workshop on 
   Reduction Strategies in Rewriting and Programming 
       http://www.dsic.upv.es/workshops/wrs2011
            29 May 2011, Novi Sad, Serbia

               An RDP 2011 workshop 
Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming


This workshop promotes research and collaboration in the area of 
reduction strategies. It encourages the presentation of new 
directions, developments, and results as well as surveys and 
tutorials on existing knowledge in this area. Reduction strategies 
define which (sub)expression(s) should be selected for evaluation 
and which rule(s) should be applied. These choices affect fundamental 
properties of computations such as laziness, strictness, completeness, 
and efficiency, to name a few. For this reason programming languages 
such as Elan, Maude, OBJ, Stratego, and TOM allow the explicit 
definition of the evaluation strategy, whereas languages such as 
Clean, Curry, and Haskell allow its modification. In addition to 
strategies in rewriting and programming, WRS also covers the use of 
strategies and tactics in other areas such as theorem and termination 
proving. 

Previous editions of the workshop were held in Utrecht (2001), 
Copenhagen (2002), Valencia (2003), Aachen (2004), Nara (2005), 
Seattle (2006), Paris (2007), Hagenberg (2008), Brasilia (2009), 
and Edinburgh (2010); the last one as a joint workshop with the 
STRATEGIES workshop. Further information can be found at the 
permanent site for WRS <http://www.dsic.upv.es/~wrs/>.

WRS 2011 is planned to be co-located with RTA 2011 (22nd International 
Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications), as a satellite 
event of RDP, the Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and 
Programming. WRS 2011 will be held at Novi Sad, Serbia on 29 May 2011.

Submissions and Publication: Before the workshop, authors are 
invited to submit an extended abstract (max. 5 pages) to be 
formatted in the EasyChair class style through the EasyChair submission site. 
Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included in the 
preliminary proceedings, available at the workshop. After the workshop, 
authors will be invited to submit a full paper of their presentation 
(typically a 15-pages paper), which will be refereed and considered 
for publication in an electronic journal, such as Electronic Proceedings 
in Theoretical Computer Science. 

Beyond original ideas and recent results not published nor submitted 
elsewhere, we also invite authors to submit a 5-pages abstract 
describing relevant work that has been or will be published elsewhere, 
or work in progress. These submissions will be only considered for 
presentation at the workshop and inclusion in the preliminary 
proceedings but not in the final proceedings.

We envisage publication of a special issue of a journal dedicated to WRS
after the event.

                      Call for papers
               21th International Symposium on
       Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                         LOPSTR 2011

             http://users.dsic.upv.es/~lopstr11/
            Odense, Denmark, July 18-20, 2011
     (co-located with PPDP 2011, AAIP 2011 and WFLP 2011)

============================================================

Objectives:

The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR
is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any
language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 21st International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2011) will be held in Odense, Denmark; previous
symposia were held in Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice,
London, Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester,
Leuven, Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester (you
might have a look at the contents of past LOPSTR symposia). LOPSTR
2011 will be co-located with PPDP 2011 (International ACM SIGPLAN
Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).


Topics:

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development,
all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-
in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Papers describing
applications in these areas are especially welcome. Contributions are
welcome on all aspects of logic-based program development, including,
but not limited to:

- specification
- synthesis
- verification
- transformation
- analysis
- optimisation
- specialization
- partial evaluation
- inversion
- composition
- program/model manipulation
- certification
- security
- transformational techniques in SE
- applications and tools

Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application  papers, that describe experience with
industrial applications, are also welcome. Papers must describe
original work, be written and presented  in English, and must not
substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are
simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed
proceedings. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted.

Following past editions, the formal post-conference proceedings will
be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
series.


IMPORTANT DATES AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:


- Paper submission: March 27,  2011
- Extended abstract submission: April 3, 2011
- Notification (for pre-proceedings): May 16, 2011
- Camera-ready (for pre-proceedings): June 12, 2011
- Symposium: July 18-20, 2011


Submissions can either be (short) extended abstracts or (full) papers
whose length should not exceed 9 and 15 pages (including references),
respectively. Submissions must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science style (excluding well-marked appendices not intended
for publication). Referees are not required to read the appendices,
and thus papers should be intelligible without them. Short papers may
describe work-in-progress or tool demonstrations.

Both short and full papers can be accepted for presentation at the
symposium and will then appear in the LOPSTR 2011
pre-proceedings. Full papers can also be immediately accepted for
publication in the formal proceedings to be published by Springer
in the LNCS series. In addition, after the symposium, the programme
committee will select further short or full papers presented
in LOPSTR 2011 to be considered for formal publication. These authors
will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the
light of the feedback solicited at the symposium. Then after another
round of reviewing, these revised papers can also be published in the
formal proceedings.

---------------------------------------------------------

Software language engineering is devoted to topics related
to artificial languages in software engineering. The foremost
mission of the International Conference on Software Language
Engineering (SLE) is to encourage and organize communication
between communities that traditionally have looked at soft-
ware languages from different, more specialized, and yet
complementary perspectives. Thus, technologies, methods,
experiments and case studies from modelware, grammarware,
and ontologyware serving the objectives of software languages
are of particular relevance to SLE.

We invite high-quality submissions to all conference tracks.
Submissions must be PDF files following the Springer LNCS
style and will be managed using the EasyChair submission system.
Please check the conference web site for further information.

SLE 2011 will include a Doctoral Symposium that will provide a
supportive yet questioning setting in which PhD students can present

INVITED SPEAKERS

SLE 2011 is proud to announce the following invited speakers.

Krzysztof Czarnecki is associate professor at the University of
Waterloo and industrial research chair at Bank of Nova Scotia / NSERC.
Before coming to Waterloo, he spent eight years at DaimlerChrysler
Research working on the practical applications of generative
programming. His current work focuses on realizing the synergies

Paul Klint is head of the software engineering department at Centrum
Wiskunde en Informatica in Amsterdam, full professor in Computer
Science at the University of Amsterdam and theme leader of Software
Analysis and Transformation at CWI. His research interests include
generic language technology, domain-specific languages, software
renovation, and technology transfer.

---------------------------------------------------------
PAPER SUBMISSION

Submitted papers must be original work and must not be
previously published in, currently submitted to, or currently
in consideration for any journal, book, conference, or
workshop. Each submitted paper will be reviewed closely by
at least three members of the program committee. Accepted
papers will be distributed at the conference via the online
proceedings as well as published in the post-proceedings,
which will appear in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (LNCS) series. Authors will have the opportunity
to revise their accepted paper(s) for the pre- and post-
proceedings. For an accepted paper to appear in the proceedings,
at least one author must attend the event and present the work.

---------------------------------------------------------
RESEARCH PAPERS

Research papers should report a substantial research contribution
to SLE and/or a successful application of SLE techniques.  We
solicit high-quality contributions in the area of SLE ranging
from theoretical and conceptual contributions to tools, techniques,
and frameworks that support the aforementioned lifecycle activities.
We list examples of tools, techniques, applications, and problems of
interest to clarify the types of contributes that we seek:

* Formalisms used in designing and specifying languages and
tools that analyze such language descriptions
* Language implementation techniques
* Program and model transformation tools
* Composition, integration, and mapping tools for managing
different aspects of software languages or different
manifestations of a given language
* Transformations and transformation languages between
languages and models
* Language evolution
* Approaches to elicitation, specification, or verification
of requirements for software languages
* Language development frameworks, methodologies, techniques,
best practices, and tools for the broader language lifecycle
covering phases such as analysis, testing , and documentation.
* Design challenges in SLE
* Applications of languages including innovative domain-specific
languages or "little" languages

The preceding list is neither exclusive nor exhaustive.  Visit
the conference web site for more information about the scope
and topics of interest of SLE, or contact the program co-chairs
with questions.

Page limit: 20

---------------------------------------------------------
SHORT PAPERS

Short papers may describe interesting or thought-provoking
concepts that are not yet fully developed or evaluated, make
an initial contribution to challenging research issues in SLE,
or discuss and analyze controversial issues in the field.

Page limit: 10

---------------------------------------------------------
TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS

Because of SLE's ample interest in tools, we seek papers
that present software tools related to the field of SLE.
These papers will accompany a tool demonstration to be given
at the conference. The selection criteria include the
originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, the relevance
of the tool to SLE, and the maturity of the tool. Submissions
may also include an appendix (that will not be published)
containing additional screen-shots and discussion of
the proposed demonstration.

Page limit: 10

---------------------------------------------------------
MINI-TUTORIAL PAPERS

SLE is composed of various research areas, such as grammarware,
modelware, language schemas, and semantic technologies. The
cross product of attendees at SLE creates a situation where
the contribution from one session may be difficult to
understand by those not initiated to the area. To help unite
the various communities of SLE 2011, we solicit mini-tutorials
that provide discussion points for mapping common ideas between
related and complementary research topics of SLE.

A mini-tutorial submission should be between 15 and 20 pages.

---------------------------------------------------------
DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM

The Doctoral Symposium provides a forum for both early and late-stage
PhD students to present their research and get detailed feedback and
advice from researchers both in and out of their particular research
area.  Submissions are invited from PhD students working on any topic
that falls within the SLE conference remit. Submissions consist of two
parts, a research abstract and a letter of recommendation from the
student's supervisor.  See the upcoming Doctoral Symposium call for
submissions for full details. Participants will also be invited to
present a poster on their research as part of the conference poster
session.

                      Call for papers
               21th International Symposium on
       Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                         LOPSTR 2011

             http://users.dsic.upv.es/~lopstr11/
            Odense, Denmark, July 18-20, 2011
     (co-located with PPDP 2011, AAIP 2011 and WFLP 2011)

============================================================

Objectives:

The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR
is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any
language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 21st International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2011) will be held in Odense, Denmark; previous
symposia were held in Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice,
London, Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester,
Leuven, Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester (you
might have a look at the contents of past LOPSTR symposia). LOPSTR
2011 will be co-located with PPDP 2011 (International ACM SIGPLAN
Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).


Topics:

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development,
all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-
in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Papers describing
applications in these areas are especially welcome. Contributions are
welcome on all aspects of logic-based program development, including,
but not limited to:

- specification
- synthesis
- verification
- transformation
- analysis
- optimisation
- specialization
- partial evaluation
- inversion
- composition
- program/model manipulation
- certification
- security
- transformational techniques in SE
- applications and tools

Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application  papers, that describe experience with
industrial applications, are also welcome. Papers must describe
original work, be written and presented  in English, and must not
substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are
simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed
proceedings. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted.

Following past editions, the formal post-conference proceedings will
be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
series.


IMPORTANT DATES AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:


- Paper submission: April 17,  2011
- Extended abstract submission: April 17, 2011
- Notification (for pre-proceedings): May 26, 2011
- Camera-ready (for pre-proceedings): June 19, 2011
- Symposium: July 18-20, 2011


Submissions can either be (short) extended abstracts or (full) papers
whose length should not exceed 9 and 15 pages (including references),
respectively. Submissions must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science style (excluding well-marked appendices not intended
for publication). Referees are not required to read the appendices,
and thus papers should be intelligible without them. Short papers may
describe work-in-progress or tool demonstrations.

Both short and full papers can be accepted for presentation at the
symposium and will then appear in the LOPSTR 2011
pre-proceedings. Full papers can also be immediately accepted for
publication in the formal proceedings to be published by Springer
in the LNCS series. In addition, after the symposium, the programme
committee will select further short or full papers presented
in LOPSTR 2011 to be considered for formal publication. These authors
will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the
light of the feedback solicited at the symposium. Then after another
round of reviewing, these revised papers can also be published in the
formal proceedings.
