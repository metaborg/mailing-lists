Scope
=====

Historically, in the first four editions of GTTSE, the school series
focused on generative and transformational techniques in software
engineering, as evident from the original acronym (GTTSE - Generative
and Transformational Techniques in Software Engineering). With the
rise of the Software Language Engineering conference, the school
series also covered that field. As of the 5th edition, a broader scope
is applied to include additional areas of software engineering, e.g.,
software analysis, empirical research, modularity, and product
lines. Thus, the new expansion of the GTTSE acronym: Grand Timely
Topics in Software Engineering. The notion of timely topics is
inspired by the ICSE conference which, in its 2015 edition, features
technical briefings as "a venue for communicating the current state of
a timely topic related to software engineering".


Format
======

The school's scientific program of GTTSE 2015 consists of 10 briefings
for different timely topics in software engineering. Each briefing is
based on a relatively short paper which combines aspects of surveying
and tutorial. The surveying aspect is realized specifically by the
design constraint for the briefings to dedicate 50% to the analysis of
related work. The remaining 50% are typically dedicated to the more
specific research of the presenters. Each briefing gets allotted 2-3
sessions with up to 3 hours in total. The speakers for the briefings
are established authorities in their respective fields.

GTTSE 2015 also features a students' workshop. These presentations may
be refined into submissions of short papers (6-8 pages LNCS style) to
be peer-reviewed and considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings
past the school.

All material presented at the school will be collected in informal
proceedings to be handed out solely to the participants. Formal and
public post-proceedings will be compiled after the summer school where
all contributions are subjected to reviewing. The post-proceedings of
the school will be published in a volume of the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science series of Springer International Publishing. The
post-proceedings of the previous four instances of the summer school
were published as LNCS 4143 (GTTSE 2005), LNCS 5235 (GTTSE 2007), LNCS
6491 (GTTSE 2009) and LNCS 7680 (GTTSE 2011).

SPLASH is now accepting submissions. We invite high quality submissions describing original and unpublished work.

Most of the following tracks have submissions due: 30 JUNE

** Demos **
The SPLASH Demonstrations track is an excellent vehicle for sharing your latest work with an experienced and technically savvy audience. Live demonstrations show the impact of software innovation. Demonstrations are not product sales pitches, but rather an opportunity to highlight, explain, and present interesting technical aspects of running applications in a dynamic and highly interactive setting. Presenters are encouraged to actively solicit feedback from the audience, which should lead to very interesting and entertaining demonstration sessions.

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-demos


** Doctoral Symposium **
The SPLASH Doctoral Symposium provides students with useful guidance for completing their dissertation research and beginning their research careers. The Symposium will provide an interactive forum for doctoral students who have progressed far enough in their research to have a structured proposal, but will not be defending their dissertation in the next 12 months.

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-ds


** Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) **
The 11th Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) at SPLASH 2015 is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to share knowledge and research on dynamic languages, their implementation, and applications. The influence of dynamic languages ? from Lisp to Smalltalk to Python to Javascript ? on real-world practice and research continues to grow.

Submissions Due: 15 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/dls2015-papers


** OOPSLA Artifacts **
The Artifact Evaluation process is a service provided by the community to help authors of accepted papers provide more substantial supplements to their papers so future researchers can more effectively build on and compare with previous work. The Artifact Evaluation Committee has been formed to assess how well paper authors prepare artifacts in support of such future researchers. Roughly, authors of papers who wish to participate are invited to submit an artifact that supports the conclusions of the paper.

Submissions Due: 9 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-artifacts


** Posters **
The SPLASH Poster track provides an excellent forum for authors to present their recent or ongoing projects in an interactive setting, and receive feedback from the community. We invite submissions covering any aspect of programming, systems, languages and applications. The goal of the poster session is to encourage and facilitate small groups of individuals interested in a technical area to gather and interact. It is held early in the conference, to promote continued discussion among interested parties. Posters can be independent presentations or associated with one of the other parts of SPLASH.

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-posters


** SPLASH-E **
The SPLASH-E track brings together researchers and educators to share educational results, ideas, and challenges centered in Software and Programming Languages. Submission formats vary, including papers, tool demos, lightning talks, challenge-topics for discussion, and suggested themes for "unconference" sessions.  Help us create an engaging forum for educational issues related to SPLASH!

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-splash-e


** Student Research Competition **
The ACM SIGPLAN Student Research Competition (ACM SRC) is an internationally-recognized venue that enables undergraduate and graduate students to experience the research world, share their research results with other students and SPLASH attendees. The competition has separate categories for undergraduate and graduate students and awards prizes to the top three students in each category. The ACM SIGPLAN Student Research Competition shares the Poster session?s goal to facilitate interaction with researchers and industry practitioners; providing both sides with the opportunity to learn of ongoing, current research.

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-src


** Student Volunteers **
The SPLASH Student Volunteer program provides an opportunity for students from around the world to associate with some of the leading personalities in industry and research in the following areas: programming languages, object-oriented technology and software development. Student volunteers contribute to the smooth running of the conference by performing tasks such as: assisting with registration, providing information about the conference to attendees, assisting session organizers and monitoring sessions.

Submissions Due: 7 August, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-sv
