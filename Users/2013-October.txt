Hi Zhaohui Yang,

We have made the ftp site available via http:

http://ftp.strategoxt.org/

(And it will soon be available again via the ftp protocol as well.)

I don't know if that is useful for use with Nix. But at least you should be
able to download the packages.

Note that the latest version of Stratego is available as part of the
Spoofax Language Workbench, providing an Eclipse editor for Stratego:

Subject: [Stratego Users] nightly not working?
Message-ID: <DUB404-EAS2295A30015F8CF4CCE8101BD01A0@phx.gbl>

Hi,

 

I've just updated to spoofax's nightly build and things seem to have stopped
working.

"Spoofax editor project" does not show up in the "New Project" window.

Trying to (re)build an existing project yields the following error:

 

        [echo] Could not load the Spoofax plugin loading classes.

        [echo] Make sure it is on the class path.

        [echo] In Eclipse, make sure the Ant builder is configured properly:

        [echo] right-click on build.main.xml, go to Run as, Ant build...,
JRE tab,

        [echo] and ensure Run in the same JRE as the workspace is selected

        [echo] alternatively, build the project using Build Project in the
Project menu

 

Is this expected behaviour?

 

Regards

Barnab?s

This happens because your Eclipse does not run on Java 7, which is a requirement for unstable and nightly.

Thanks. My bad, I was convinced I had Java 7 but now that you say, java
-version tells otherwise.

I understand that the type-checking system is evolving, but is there any
documentation for what exists today?  The example projects all have a
types.str file but I can't find any documentation showing how NaBL or any
other parts of Spoofax call the rules defined there.  A basic explanation
of how and when things are called would be helpful.  I suspect such an
explanation would also need to touch a bit on the task system as well.

As demonstrated on Monday, we have a prototype type system DSL that we are
including in the nightly build now. We will be demonstrating this at SPLASH
next Tuesday (10:30) and are otherwise also available to demonstrate this
at SPLASH. The implementation is based on the Spoofax Task Engine (see our
SLE talk on Monday) and should be fairly solid. But we still have to
evaluate coverage on larger languages and performance on larger
programs/projects. On small/simple DSLs the current prototype is probably
already sufficient.

And yes, we will write some documentation as well.

 CALL FOR PAPERS

                 4th International Workshop on
        Model-driven Approaches for Simulation Engineering
    part of the Symposium on Theory of Modeling and Simulation
                     (SCS SpringSim 2014)


#################################################################

April 13-16, 2014, Tampa, FL (USA)
http://www.sel.uniroma2.it/Mod4Sim14

#################################################################
# Papers Due: *** November 22, 2013 *** extended
# Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings
# and archived in the ACM Digital Library.
#################################################################

The workshop aims to bring together experts in model-based, model-driven
and software engineering with experts in simulation methods and simulation
practitioners, with the objective to advance the state of the art in
model-driven simulation engineering.

Model-driven engineering approaches provide considerable advantages to
software systems engineering activities through the provision of consistent
and coherent models at different abstraction levels. As these models are in
a machine readable form, model-driven engineering approaches can also
support the exploitation of computing capabilities for model reuse,
programming code generation, and model checking, for example.

The definition of a simulation model, its software implementation and its
execution platform form what is known as simulation engineering. As
simulation systems are mainly based on software, these systems can
similarly benefit from model-driven approaches to support automatic
software generation, enhance software quality, and reduce costs,
development effort and time-to-market.

Similarly to systems and software engineering, simulation engineering can
exploit the capabilities of model-driven approaches by increasing the
abstraction level in simulation model specifications and by automating the
derivation of simulator code. Further advantages can be gained by using
modeling languages, such as UML and SysML ? but not exclusively those. For
example, modeling languages can be used for descriptive modeling (to
describe the system to be simulated), for analytical modeling (to specify
analytically the simulation of the same system), and for implementation
modeling (to define the respective simulator).

A partial list of topics of interest includes:

* model-driven simulation engineering processes
* requirements modeling for simulation
* domain specific languages for modeling and simulation
* model transformations for simulation model building
* model transformations for simulation model implementation
* model-driven engineering of distributed simulation systems
* relationship between metamodeling standards (e.g., MOF, Ecore) and
distributed simulation standards (e.g., HLA, DIS)
* metamodels for simulation reuse and interoperability
* model-driven technologies for different simulation paradigms (discrete
event simulation, multi-agent simulation, sketch-based * simulation, etc.)
* model-driven methods and tools for performance engineering of simulation
systems
* simulation tools for model-driven software performance engineering
* model-driven technologies for simulation verification and validation
* model-driven technologies for data collection and analysis
* model-driven technologies for simulation visualization
* Executable UML
* Executable Architectures
* SysML / Modelica integration
* Simulation Model Portability and reuse
* model-based systems verification and validation
* simulation for model-based systems engineering

To stimulate creativity, however, the workshop maintains a wider scope and
welcomes contributions offering original perspectives on model-driven
engineering of simulation systems.

10th International Workshop on Rewriting Logic and its Applications

WRLA 2014
Grenoble, France, April 5th and 6th, 2014
http://www.dsic.upv.es/workshops/wrla2014/

The workshop will be held in conjunction with
ETAPS 2014
17th European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software
April 5-13, 2014
http://www.etaps.org/2014

AIMS AND SCOPE

Rewriting logic (RL) is a natural model of computation and an 
expressive semantic framework for concurrency, parallelism, 
communication, and interaction. It can be used for specifying 
a wide range of systems and languages in various application 
fields. It also has good properties as a metalogical framework 
for representing logics. In recent years, several languages 
based on RL (ASF+SDF, CafeOBJ, ELAN, Maude) have been designed 
and implemented. The aim of the workshop is to bring together 
researchers with a common interest in RL and its applications, 
and to give them the opportunity to present their recent works, 
discuss future research directions, and exchange ideas.

The topics of the workshop comprise, but are not limited to,
- foundations and models of RL;
- languages based on RL, including implementation issues;
- RL as a logical framework;
- RL as a semantic framework, including applications of RL to
  - object-oriented systems,
  - concurrent and/or parallel systems,
  - interactive, distributed, open ended and mobile systems,
  - specification of languages and systems;
- use of RL to provide rigorous support for model-based software 
 engineering;
- formalisms related to RL, including
  - real-time and probabilistic extensions of RL,
  - rewriting approaches to behavioral specifications,
  - tile logic;
- verification techniques for RL specifications, including
  - equational and coherence methods,
  - verification of properties expressed in first-order, 
    higher-order, modal and temporal logics,
  - narrowing-based analysis and verification;
- comparisons of RL with existing formalisms having analogous aims;
- application of RL to specification and analysis of
  - distributed systems,
  - physical systems.

IMPORTANT DATES

Submission deadline          December 30th 2013
Author notification          February 2nd 2014

SUBMISSIONS

The final program of the workshop will include regular papers, 
tool papers, and work-in-progress presentations. The program 
will also contain invited talks to be determined by the 
program committee. Papers must contain original contributions, 
be clearly written, include appropriate references, and 
comparison with related work. They must be unpublished and 
not submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere. 
Tool papers present a new tool, a new tool component, or 
novel extensions to an existing tool. They should provide a 
short description of the theoretical foundations with 
relevant citations, emphasize the design and implementation,
and give a clear account of the tool's functionality. The
described tools must be publicly available via the web.
All submissions should be formatted according to the 
guidelines for Springer LNCS papers, and should be submitted 
electronically using EasyChair.

Regular papers and work-in-progress should not exceed 
15 pages including references. Tool papers can have a 
maximum of 6 pages including references and may have 
an appendix of up to 4 additional pages with 
usage details and tool demonstration.

PROCEEDINGS

All submissions will be evaluated by the Program Committee. 
Regular papers, tool papers, and work-in-progress that 
are accepted will be presented at the workshop and 
included in the proceedings, which will be available
during the workshop. Regular papers, tool papers, and 
invited presentations will also be published in a volume 
in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
(LNCS) series to be distributed after the workshop. 

Depending on the number and the quality of the contributions, 
we will consider the preparation of a special issue in some 
scientific journal in the field with extended versions of a 
selection of the papers of the workshop.
