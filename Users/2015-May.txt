                      CALL FOR PAPERS

                          WGP 2015

       11th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Generic Programming
                     Vancouver, Canada
                   Sunday, August 30, 2015

               http://www.wgp-sigplan.org/2015

                     Co-located with the
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2015)
======================================================================


Goals of the workshop
---------------------

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making
them more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds
of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably
instantiating their parameters. In contrast with normal programs, the
parameters of a generic program are often quite rich in structure; for
example they may be other programs, types or type constructors, class
hierarchies, or even programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to
practitioners and to theoreticians, and, for at least 20 years,
generic programming techniques have been a specific focus of research
in the functional and object-oriented programming communities. Generic
programming has gradually spread to more and more mainstream
languages, and today is widely used in industry. This workshop brings
together leading researchers and practitioners in generic programming
from around the world, and features papers capturing the state of the
art in this important area.

We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical as well as
practical, of

* generic programming,
* programming with (C++) concepts,
* meta-programming,
* programming with type classes,
* programming with modules,
* programming with dependent types,
* type systems for generic programming,
* polytypic programming,
* adaptive object-oriented programming,
* component-based programming,
* strategic programming,
* aspect-oriented programming,
* family polymorphism,
* object-oriented generic programming,
* implementation of generic programming languages,
* static and dynamic analyses of generic programs,
* and so on.

* Regular research papers (12 pages)
* Short papers: case studies, tool demos, generic pearls (6 pages)

Regular research papers are expected to present novel and interesting
research results. Short papers need not present novel or fully polished
results. Good candidates for short papers are those that report on 
interesting case studies of generic programming in open source or 
industry, present demos of generic programming tools or libraries, 
or discuss elegant and illustrative uses of generic programming ('pearls').

All submissions should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (two-column, 9pt). Regular 
research papers must not exceed 12 pages. Short papers must not exceed 
6 pages. If applicable, papers should be marked with one of the labels
'case study, 'tool demo' or 'generic pearl' in the title at the time 
of submission.

    Educational approaches and perspectives
    Semantics of dynamic languages

== Invited Speaker ==

DLS is pleased to announce a talk by the following invited speaker:

  Eelco Visser: Declare your Language.


== Submissions and proceedings ==

Submissions should not have been published previously nor under review
at other events. Research papers should describe work that advances
the current state of the art. Experience papers should be of broad
interest and should describe insights gained from substantive
practical applications. The program committee will evaluate each
contributed paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity,
length, and originality.

Papers are to be submitted electronically at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=dls15 in PDF
format. Submissions must be in the ACM format (see
http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm) and not exceed 12
pages. Authors are reminded that brevity is a virtue.

DLS 2015 will run a two-phase reviewing process to help authors make
their final papers the best that they can be. After the first round of
reviews, papers will be rejected, conditionally accepted, or
unconditionally accepted. Conditionally accepted papers will be given
a list of issues raised by reviewers. Authors will then submit a
revised version of the paper with a cover letter explaining how they
have or why they have not addressed these issues. The reviewers will
then consider the cover letter and revised paper and recommend final
acceptance or rejection.

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

The ACM SIGPLAN conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery to make it the premier conference at the intersection of programming, languages, and software engineering. SPLASH is now accepting submissions. We invite high quality submissions describing original and unpublished work.


** Demos **
The SPLASH Demonstrations track is an excellent vehicle for sharing your latest work with an experienced and technically savvy audience. Live demonstrations show the impact of software innovation. Demonstrations are not product sales pitches, but rather an opportunity to highlight, explain, and present interesting technical aspects of running applications in a dynamic and highly interactive setting. Presenters are encouraged to actively solicit feedback from the audience, which should lead to very interesting and entertaining demonstration sessions.

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-demos


** Doctoral Symposium **
The SPLASH Doctoral Symposium provides students with useful guidance for completing their dissertation research and beginning their research careers. The Symposium will provide an interactive forum for doctoral students who have progressed far enough in their research to have a structured proposal, but will not be defending their dissertation in the next 12 months.

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-ds


** OOPSLA Artifacts **
The Artifact Evaluation process is a service provided by the community to help authors of accepted papers provide more substantial supplements to their papers so future researchers can more effectively build on and compare with previous work. The Artifact Evaluation Committee has been formed to assess how well paper authors prepare artifacts in support of such future researchers. Roughly, authors of papers who wish to participate are invited to submit an artifact that supports the conclusions of the paper.

Submissions Due: 9 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-artifacts


** Posters **
The SPLASH Poster track provides an excellent forum for authors to present their recent or ongoing projects in an interactive setting, and receive feedback from the community. We invite submissions covering any aspect of programming, systems, languages and applications. The goal of the poster session is to encourage and facilitate small groups of individuals interested in a technical area to gather and interact. It is held early in the conference, to promote continued discussion among interested parties. Posters can be independent presentations or associated with one of the other parts of SPLASH.

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-posters


** SPLASH-E **
The SPLASH-E track brings together researchers and educators to share educational results, ideas, and challenges centered in Software and Programming Languages. Submission formats vary, including papers, tool demos, lightning talks, challenge-topics for discussion, and suggested themes for "unconference" sessions.  Help us create an engaging forum for educational issues related to SPLASH!

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-splash-e


** Student Research Competition **
The ACM SIGPLAN Student Research Competition (ACM SRC) is an internationally-recognized venue that enables undergraduate and graduate students to experience the research world, share their research results with other students and SPLASH attendees. The competition has separate categories for undergraduate and graduate students and awards prizes to the top three students in each category. The ACM SIGPLAN Student Research Competition shares the Poster session?s goal to facilitate interaction with researchers and industry practitioners; providing both sides with the opportunity to learn of ongoing, current research.

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-src


** Student Volunteers **
The SPLASH Student Volunteer program provides an opportunity for students from around the world to associate with some of the leading personalities in industry and research in the following areas: programming languages, object-oriented technology and software development. Student volunteers contribute to the smooth running of the conference by performing tasks such as: assisting with registration, providing information about the conference to attendees, assisting session organizers and monitoring sessions.

Submissions Due: 7 August, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-sv


** Tutorials **
The SPLASH 2015 Tutorials programme will consist of prestigious tutorials on current topics in software, systems, and languages research. The scope of Tutorials is the same as the conference itself: all aspects of software construction and delivery at the intersection of programming, languages, and software engineering. Tutorials in particular focus on the nexus between research and practice, including work that takes inspiration from or builds connections to areas not commonly considered at SPLASH. Tutorials should introduce researchers to current research in an area, or show important new tools that can be used in research.

Submissions Due: 30 June, 2015
http://2015.splashcon.org/track/splash2015-tutorials


** Wavefront **
The SPLASH Wavefront track is looking for presentations and technology talks of interest to the software community, particularly to software professionals working in companies large and small.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE

GPCE is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in techniques
that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and component
deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software quality,
and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition to
exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to
foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the
programming languages research communities.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
TOPICS OF INTEREST 

GPCE seeks contributions on all topics related to generative software and
its properties. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Generative software
* Domain-specific languages (language extension, language embedding,
  language design, language theory, language workbenches, interpreters,
  compilers)
* Product lines (domain engineering, feature-oriented and
  aspect-oriented programming, pre-processors, feature interactions)
* Metaprogramming (reflection, staging, partial evaluation), Type
  systems, Program synthesis
* Implementation techniques and tool support (components, plug-ins,
  libraries, metaprogramming, macros, templates, generic programming,
  run-time code generation, model-driven development, composition tools,
  code-completion and code-recommendation systems)

Practical Applications and Empirical evaluations
* Empirical evaluations of all topics above (user studies, substantial case
  studies, controlled experiments, surveys, rigorous measurements)  
* Application areas and engineering practice (Cloud Computing, Internet of
  Things, Cyber Physical Systems, Mobile Computing, Software Defined
  Networking, High Performance Computing, Patterns and Middleware,
  Development methods)

Properties of generative software
* Correctness of generators and generated code (analysis, testing, formal
  methods, domain-specific error messages, safety, security)   
* Reuse and evolution
* Modularity, separation of concerns, understandability, and
  maintainability  
* Performance engineering, nonfunctional properties (program optimization
  and parallelization, GPGPUs, multicore, footprint, metrics)

We particularly welcome papers that address some of the key challenges in
the field, such as, 
* synthesizing code from declarative specifications
* supporting extensible languages and language embedding
* ensuring correctness and other nonfunctional properties of generated code
* proving generators correct
* improving error reporting with domain-specific error messages
* reasoning about generators
* handling variability-induced complexity in product lines
* providing efficient interpreters and execution languages
* human factors in developing and maintaining generators 

GPCE encourages submissions about empirical evaluations and applications of
generative software, and such papers will be given special consideration
during reviewing.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Requesting opinions about Stratego and Spoofax for
 manually-directed program transformation
Message-ID: <55671C66.9090508@cs.haverford.edu>

Hi Stratego Users ---

Before putting more resources into installing Spoofax and Stratego (*), 
I'd like to ask for your opinions about whether it is an appropriate 
tool for my goals.

Specifically, I'm looking for a system to help first-year undergraduate 
CS students get a sense of the idea of code rewriting as a way of 
reasoning about computation, to see the relationship between mathematics 
and software more clearly at this early point in their education. I'd 
like a system that lets a user select and apply a code transformation 
(e.g., substitute the definition of a specific variable for all uses of 
that variable, in pure functional code in a simple language for which we 
have some rewrite rules). From the documentation, it /looks/ like 
Spoofax and Stratego might be good tools for this. There are a number of 
code rewriting or proof construction tools that could do what I want the 
students to do, but they seem to be /too automatic/ for my purposes ... 
e.g., for even the most challenging first-semester problems I pose (show 
that the substitution rules can transform program A into program B), 
we'd just have to tell a tool like Coq "simplify"; I want the students 
to come up with the transformations themselves.

So ... do you think Spoofax and Stratego might be appropriate?  (Or, are 
there other tools I should be considering?).

Thanks for any information you can provide,
         Dave W

(*) We've been having some trouble getting Spoofax to work on the "tour 
of spoofax" example from the web site 
<http://metaborg.org/spoofax/tour/>, but will persevere and/or file a 
proper bug report if we get stumped.

Hi David,

That depends a bit on the specifics of your use case. I'd be happy to
discuss this off-list.

cheers,
