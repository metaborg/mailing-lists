Rewriting is a branch of computer science whose origins go back 
to the origins of computer science itself (with Thue, Church, 
Post, and many other prominent researchers). It has strong links 
with mathematics, algebra, and logic, and it is the basis of 
well-known programming paradigms like functional and equational 
programming, which are taught at the universitary level in many 
countries. In these programming paradigms and corresponding 
languages, the notions of reduction, pattern matching, 
confluence, termination, strategy, etc., are essential. 
Rewriting provides a solid framework for understanding, using, 
and teaching all these notions. Rewriting techniques are also 
used in many other areas of software engineering (scripting, 
prototyping, automated transformation of legacy systems, 
refactoring, web services, etc.) and are implemented in popular 
systems like Mathematica, Autocad, and others. Rewriting 
techniques play a relevant role in computing research, 
education, and industry.

The International School on Rewriting is promoted by the IFIP 
Working Group 1.6 Term Rewriting. The school is aimed at master 
and PhD students, researchers, and practitioners interested in 
the study of rewriting concepts and their applications.

Two tracks are offered, including the lectures and the courses:

- Track A: for newcomers in the field, or just for people 
          who want to obtain a new, updated exposure.

 * Jose Meseguer. Introduction to Term Rewriting
 * Albert Rubio. Termination of Rewriting: Foundations and 
   Automation
 * Santiago Escobar. A Rewriting-Based Specification and 
   Programming Language: Maude
 * Beatriz Alarcon & Raul Gutierrez. Exercises on Term 
   Rewriting

- Track B: for those who want to get deeper in the most 
          recent developments and applications of rewriting.

Hello,

When I open up a large .aterm file with the spoofax editor

An internal error occurred during: "ATerm ParserScheduler for foo.aterm".
java.lang.StackOverflowError

The settings in eclipse.ini are as follows

Hi,
I started using Spoofax (last version from the eclipse update site) with
Eclipse 3.7. I want to generate my own plugins for the mobl language (
http://www.mobl-lang.org/). The generation works but I was wondering, if
it's possible to skip parts of the Spoofax features (
http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax/Features), e.g., skip support for rewrite
rules for code generation or live abstract syntax view.

Is it possible to do that in Eclipse with Spoofax?

I suppose you can just turn off those features in the editor
descriptors (esv files) of the mobl language.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Following all branches in a non-confluent
	transformation system
Message-ID: <CAJjbr66S-GJq5BMMuFh0AYn4tt12m5=GEj9qW-GVPV=9pCsezg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have to implement a source-to-source transformation where the
transformation rules are context-sensitive. Stratego's Dynamic Rules
offer me an easy way to build those rules during runtime. The
application of those rules is always terminating but not confluent.

1) Is there a way to generate all possible results, e.i. follow each
possible branch?
2) From all possible results there is at least one result which is
"better" than the others (results can be compared by calculating a
single number for each result, the lower the better). Is it possible
to select a "best" result?

Thanks,
Marcus

The short answer is no. Stratego was designed to support strategies
that make a choice at run-time from the possibilities of non-confluent
rewrite system. So it has no built in support for backtracking over
all possible rewrites. If you want arbitrary backtracking you should
probably look at systems that support that.

However, depending on transformation problem and rules your are
dealing with, it may be possible to implement a suitable strategy.

Surely, if you find a way to transform a program to N result programs
you can compute the metric for each such program and then select the
one with the lowest value. This depends of course on a suitable and
meaningful definition of a comparison metric. Implementation of metric
computation should generally not be a problem in Stratego.

I commented out the import of e.g., MoBL-Colorer, and others in the
MoBL.main.esv file. After rebuilding the project and generating the mobl
plugin I was wondering why the mobl-plugin was almost the same size (<
300KB) as it was with all the tool support. I thought the entire editor
support is generated per configuration and therefore should have a larger
impact on the resulting jar file.

The editor services DSLs are interpreted by the Spoofax run-time
system. So there's not a large amount of Java code that gets
generated, and that you can save by turning off those features.

What are you trying to achieve?

I'm trying to generate a customized mobl plugin, leaving out specific
language features of mobl and try to generate a tailor-made IDE for that
language.

Thx for Your help. The last post answers all further questions regarding
spoofax.
