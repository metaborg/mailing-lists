Message-ID: <AANLkTinFJRUFT8ndvkw4ou-w=r-AakGBJj2s30mg_Jzu@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I want to write a java primitive for stratego, or strj I guess.
Below is an example of the what I want the java code to do.
How do I use this as a stratego extension?

Cheers,

Shannon

Hi Shannon,

If you create a Spoofax project, it provides an example of how to do this in the editor/java/.../strategies/java_strategy_0_0.java file. This is a Java class that subclasses the Strategy class, and it can be invoked form Stratego if you import it as follows:

  external java-strategy(|) // tell stratego it has 0 strategy and 0 term arguments

  main = java-strategy // now it works

Other than that, there are some boilerplate classes in that same editor/java/.../strategies directory. The important one is the InteropRegisterer that must list all Java strategy. The standard build script compiles all the classes in the directory to a JAR file, and imports the JAR file again when compiling with strj and javac.

For your example you would just need to marshal the Stratego ATerms to a Java int[][]. From an IStrategoTerm, you can determine its type using the getTermType() method, and then cast it to IStrategoList or IStrategoInt for a list or integers. Let me know if you run into any trouble with all this :)

hth,

Lennart

Subject: [Stratego Users] compilation: lt-xtc running infinitely
Message-ID: <COL112-DS8C71BF98B2EDF8032DE34D0E80@phx.gbl>

Hi there,

 

I have been trying to build Stratego/XT from sources for an ARM box, but
compilation hangs. 

Everything goes well until: make[2]: Entering directory
`/data/root/stratego/strategoxt-1.8pre21764/xtc/src'

After this, the 3rd step runs lt-xtc:

 

/root/stratego/strategoxt-1.8pre21764/xtc/src/.libs/lt-xtc -r
/root/stratego/strategoxt-1.8pre21764/BUILDTIME_XTC register -l
/root/stratego/strategoxt-1.8pre21764/xtc/src -V 1.8 -t xtc-lib.str

 

lt-xtc eats up 100% of CPU time and does nothing. So far, it has run 6+
hours, so I think this is not normal.

I have tried many configurations: latest (strategoxt-1.8pre21764) and latest
stable (0.17) on an ARM/Debian box and on a freshly installed Ubuntu on x64.
The command line was simply ./configure && make.

 

What am I doing wrong?

 

Thanks

Barnab?s Kr?lik

============================================================

            2nd CALL FOR PAPERS

                    SLE 2011
4th International Conference on Software Language Engineering

          Braga, Portugal, 3-6 July 2011

          http://planet-sl.org/sle2011/

    Co-located with the 4th Summer School on Generative and
 Transformational Techniques in Software Engineering
                    (GTTSE 2011)

=============================================================

IMPORTANT DATES

* 2011:
Paper submission: April 08 (midnight Apia Samoa time)
Author notification: May 13
Paper submission for online proceedings: June 17
Conference: July 03-06
Camera-ready copy submission for post-proceedings: August 29

---------------------------------------------------------

Software language engineering is devoted to topics related
to artificial languages in software engineering. The foremost
mission of the International Conference on Software Language
Engineering (SLE) is to encourage and organize communication
between communities that traditionally have looked at soft-
ware languages from different, more specialized, and yet
complementary perspectives. Thus, technologies, methods,
experiments and case studies from modelware, grammarware,
and ontologyware serving the objectives of software languages
are of particular relevance to SLE.

We invite high-quality submissions to all conference tracks.
Submissions must be PDF files following the Springer LNCS
style and will be managed using the EasyChair submission system.
Please check the conference web site for further information.

SLE 2011 will include a Doctoral Symposium that will provide a
supportive yet questioning setting in which PhD students can
present their work, including goals, methods, and preliminary
results. The Symposium aims to provide students with useful
guidance and feedback on various aspects of their research from
established researchers and the other student attendees.

Please forward this call to anyone who might be interested.

http://planet-sl.org/sle2011/

---------------------------------------------------------
PAPER SUBMISSION

Submitted papers must be original work and must not be
previously published in, currently submitted to, or currently
in consideration for any journal, book, conference, or
workshop. Each submitted paper will be reviewed closely by
at least three members of the program committee. Accepted
papers will be distributed at the conference via the online
proceedings as well as published in the post-proceedings,
which will appear in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer
Science (LNCS) series. Authors will have the opportunity
to revise their accepted paper(s) for the pre- and post-
proceedings. For an accepted paper to appear in the proceedings,
at least one author must attend the event and present the work.

---------------------------------------------------------
RESEARCH PAPERS

Research papers should report a substantial research contribution
to SLE and/or a successful application of SLE techniques.  We
solicit high-quality contributions in the area of SLE ranging
from theoretical and conceptual contributions to tools, techniques,
and frameworks that support the aforementioned lifecycle activities.
We list examples of tools, techniques, applications, and problems of
interest to clarify the types of contributes that we seek:

* Formalisms used in designing and specifying languages and
tools that analyze such language descriptions
* Language implementation techniques
* Program and model transformation tools
* Composition, integration, and mapping tools for managing
different aspects of software languages or different
manifestations of a given language
* Transformations and transformation languages between
languages and models
* Language evolution
* Approaches to elicitation, specification, or verification
of requirements for software languages
* Language development frameworks, methodologies, techniques,
best practices, and tools for the broader language lifecycle
covering phases such as analysis, testing , and documentation.
* Design challenges in SLE
* Applications of languages including innovative domain-specific
languages or "little" languages

The preceding list is neither exclusive nor exhaustive.  Visit
the conference web site for more information about the scope
and topics of interest of SLE, or contact the program co-chairs
with questions.

Page limit: 20

---------------------------------------------------------
SHORT PAPERS

Short papers may describe interesting or thought-provoking
concepts that are not yet fully developed or evaluated, make
an initial contribution to challenging research issues in SLE,
or discuss and analyze controversial issues in the field.

Page limit: 10

---------------------------------------------------------
TOOL DEMONSTRATION PAPERS

Because of SLE's ample interest in tools, we seek papers
that present software tools related to the field of SLE.
These papers will accompany a tool demonstration to be given
at the conference. The selection criteria include the
originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, the relevance
of the tool to SLE, and the maturity of the tool. Submissions
may also include an appendix (that will not be published)
containing additional screen-shots and discussion of
the proposed demonstration.

Page limit: 10

---------------------------------------------------------
MINI-TUTORIAL PAPERS

SLE is composed of various research areas, such as grammarware,
modelware, language schemas, and semantic technologies. The
cross product of attendees at SLE creates a situation where
the contribution from one session may be difficult to
understand by those not initiated to the area. To help unite
the various communities of SLE 2011, we solicit mini-tutorials
that provide discussion points for mapping common ideas between
related and complementary research topics of SLE.

A mini-tutorial submission should be between 15 and 20 pages.

---------------------------------------------------------
DOCTORAL SYMPOSIUM

The Doctoral Symposium provides a forum for both early and late-stage
PhD students to present their research and get detailed feedback and
advice from researchers both in and out of their particular research
area.  Submissions are invited from PhD students working on any topic
that falls within the SLE conference remit. Submissions consist of two
parts, a research abstract and a letter of recommendation from the
student's supervisor.  See the upcoming Doctoral Symposium call for
submissions for full details. Participants will also be invited to
present a poster on their research as part of the conference poster
session.

Hi,

this looks like you are using aterm without a needed patch. The correct
aterm version to use is aterm-2.5 with this patch:
https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs/development/libraries/aterm/max-long.patch
as can be found on this page:
http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/StrategoDownload

hope this helps,
Rob Vermaas

Hi Lennart,

That worked fine thanks, I managed to implement a basic java strategy.
However, I am getting a NoClassDefFoundError on ISolver, part of sat4j.
I tried copying the sat4j jar into my project's root directory and added the
following line to build.main.xml:

<property name="externaljar" value="org.sat4j.core_2.2.0.SQUEEZE.jar"/>

Still no luck though.

Cheers,

Shannon

Hi Shannon,

The NoClassDefFoundError indicates that it's not on the runtime classpath. In Spoofax you can add additional jars to the classpath by adding an entry like this to the editor/*-Builders.esv file:

  provider: lib/org.sat4j.core_2.2.0.SQUEEZE.jar

hth,

Lennart

Hi,

 

Thanks for the help. Sorry for bothering, this was an obvious RTFM indeed.

 

Greetings

Hi,

this looks like you are using aterm without a needed patch. The correct
aterm version to use is aterm-2.5 with this patch:
https://svn.nixos.org/repos/nix/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs/development/libraries/ate
rm/max-long.patch 
as can be found on this page:
http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/StrategoDownload

hope this helps,

Hi there,

 

I have been trying to build Stratego/XT from sources for an ARM box, but
compilation hangs. 

Everything goes well until: make[2]: Entering directory
`/data/root/stratego/strategoxt-1.8pre21764/xtc/src'

After this, the 3rd step runs lt-xtc:

 

/root/stratego/strategoxt-1.8pre21764/xtc/src/.libs/lt-xtc -r
/root/stratego/strategoxt-1.8pre21764/BUILDTIME_XTC register -l
/root/stratego/strategoxt-1.8pre21764/xtc/src -V 1.8 -t xtc-lib.str

 

lt-xtc eats up 100% of CPU time and does nothing. So far, it has run 6+
hours, so I think this is not normal.

I have tried many configurations: latest (strategoxt-1.8pre21764) and latest
stable (0.17) on an ARM/Debian box and on a freshly installed Ubuntu on x64.
The command line was simply ./configure && make.

 

What am I doing wrong?

 

Thanks

Barnab?s Kr?lik

Hi guys,

Simple question this time: how do I fail from a java strategy?  Currently I
use

if(sat) return factory.makeString("true");
return factory.makeString("false");

and then ?"false" in my stratego program.

Cheers,

Shannon

Message-ID: <AANLkTimmpWDpBKi3SaN2iAqZJH6i8o7GVJGQ4hbr-q+z@mail.gmail.com>

==========================================================================
Call for Papers

Onward! 2011

The ACM Conference on New Ideas in Programming and Reflections on Software

October 22-27, 2011
Portland, Oregon, USA

Co-located with SPLASH/OOPSLA 2011

Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN
==========================================================================

Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other
conferences to not
so well-proven but well-argued ideas. We welcome different ways of
thinking about,
approaching, and reporting on programming language and software
engineering research.

Onward! fosters the multidisciplinarity of software development. We
are interested in
anything to do with programming and software. Processes, methods,
languages, art,
philosophy, biology, economics, communities, politics, ethics, and of course
applications. Anything!

Sounds good? Do you want to report on and present your new ideas to
the community and
get feedback? Do you have a video to show or a story to tell? Do you
want to bring
new insights to the community? Or you just want to know more about innovations,
visions and the future of programming languages and software
engineering? Then...

Join Onward!, the unique, creative and collaborative environment to discuss and
investigate challenging problems related to software, its creation and
nurturing.

Call for Research Papers
========================

Have you ever wished you could get your ideas out there for comment
quickly? Have you
ever wondered where are the conferences or journals that cater to work
earlier than
usual in the scientific cycle?

Onward! is that place. At Onward! we are interested in papers that
describe work with
potential to change significantly the field. But Onward! isn''t a
venue for just any
old thing - an Onward! paper must say something substantially
original, and must be
sufficiently important and interesting to deserve the attention of the
programming
and software communities. An Onward! paper must present some
supporting evidence -
not pure conjecture. Evidence may be in the form of a compelling argument or
analysis, a sketch of validity, or an initial implementation.

The scope of an Onward! paper can be broad: It can be single idea, a
new approach, or
a new paradigm. It can talk about programming languages, programming
methodologies,
process, software engineering, collaboration, and anything to do with
programming and
creating software.

But above all, an Onward! paper must be well thought out, well-written, and
compelling in its argument.

Onward! is a fully peer-reviewed conference, and accepted papers will
appear in the
SPLASH (formerly OOPSLA) proceedings and the ACM Digital Library.

Theme: Software Language Design
===============================

Collectively the software language community is exploring the space of language
designs. It often takes many years for a design (a point in this space) to be
implemented, applied, and evaluated. Language design is very much an art. Can we
speed up the process by more systematic methods? What properties do
good language
designs have? What are good language design patterns? How can we
evaluate language
design at an early stage, i.e. before an implementation exists? Can we
(and should
we) incorporate method from human-computer interaction in the
evaluation of language
designs? Can we use user-centered design methods to inform language design? Can
programming language designers learn from the design methodologies of other
disciplines such as architecture and industrial design? Are there
principled ways to
guide and evaluate software language designs other than empirical experiment and
mathematical proof? What assumptions do we hold so dearly about
programming languages
that it would be heresy to question them? This year the Onward! PC
would welcome in
particular papers reflecting on the future of software language design.

Author Guidelines
=================

All papers will be peer-reviewed by members of the Onward 2010 program
committee and
additional expert reviewers drawn from relevant research communities.

Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, significance of the
contribution to the field, technical correctness and presentation. If
a submitted
paper may appear to overlap with the previously published or
simultaneously reviewed
work, the authors should email the Program Chair directly to explain
how the new work
represents a unique and substantial new contribution.  Submission

   1. Electronic submission through easychair is required:
   http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=onward11

   2. Submissions must be in ACM SIGPLAN 10 point format; templates
for Microsoft
   Word and LaTeX are available. For ease of reviewing, please include
page numbers
   in your submission. (Note that the SIGPLAN formats differ from the
standard ACM
   formats in some respects.)

   3. Papers must be submitted in PDF format. PDF files must be created to allow
   printing, and must be readily printable on a modestly configured color laser
   printer.

   4. Final camera-ready essays must also be formatted to conform to SIGPLAN
   Proceedings requirements. Details will be released once your paper has been
   accepted.

   5. Papers must be both no longer than 10,000 words and no longer
than 20 pages
   when formatted under the SIGPLAN templates. Papers violating these
guidelines will
   be rejected without review; contact the essays chairThis e-mail
address is being
   protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it in
advance if you
   have any doubts about the length of your paper.

   6. Onward! and OOPSLA provide a number of other publication venues;
papers that
   are not accepted to the research program may, at the discretion of
the committee,
   be forwarded for consideration for the OOPSLA research program.

   7. Papers must not have been previously published, and must not be
concurrently
   submitted for publication elsewhere (including journals and formal
proceedings of
   conferences and workshops). Violation of this policy will result in
rejection of

============================================================

                      Call for papers
               21th International Symposium on
       Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation
                         LOPSTR 2011

             http://users.dsic.upv.es/~lopstr11/
            Odense, Denmark, July 18-20, 2011
                  (co-located with PPDP 2011)

============================================================

Objectives:

The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR
is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any
language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 21st International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2011) will be held in Odense, Denmark; previous
symposia were held in Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice,
London, Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice, Manchester,
Leuven, Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester (you
might have a look at the contents of past LOPSTR symposia). LOPSTR
2011 will be co-located with PPDP 2011 (International ACM SIGPLAN
Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).


Topics:

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development,
all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-
in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Papers describing
applications in these areas are especially welcome. Contributions are
welcome on all aspects of logic-based program development, including,
but not limited to:

- specification
- synthesis
- verification
- transformation
- analysis
- optimisation
- specialization
- partial evaluation
- inversion
- composition
- program/model manipulation
- certification
- security
- transformational techniques in SE
- applications and tools

Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application  papers, that describe experience with
industrial applications, are also welcome. Papers must describe
original work, be written and presented  in English, and must not
substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are
simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed
proceedings. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
published workshops proceedings may be submitted.

Following past editions, the formal post-conference proceedings will
be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)
series.


IMPORTANT DATES AND SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:


- Paper submission: March 27,  2011
- Extended abstract submission: April 3, 2011
- Notification (for pre-proceedings): May 16, 2011
- Camera-ready (for pre-proceedings): June 12, 2011
- Symposium: July 18-20, 2011


Submissions can either be (short) extended abstracts or (full) papers
whose length should not exceed 9 and 15 pages (including references),
respectively. Submissions must be formatted in the Lecture Notes in
Computer Science style (excluding well-marked appendices not intended
for publication). Referees are not required to read the appendices,
and thus papers should be intelligible without them. Short papers may
describe work-in-progress or tool demonstrations.

Both short and full papers can be accepted for presentation at the
symposium and will then appear in the LOPSTR 2011
pre-proceedings. Full papers can also be immediately accepted for
publication in the formal proceedings to be published by Springer
in the LNCS series. In addition, after the symposium, the programme
committee will select further short or full papers presented
in LOPSTR 2011 to be considered for formal publication. These authors
will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the
light of the feedback solicited at the symposium. Then after another
round of reviewing, these revised papers can also be published in the
formal proceedings.

Subject: [Stratego Users] How to control when analysis for marker generation
	is performed
Message-ID: <AANLkTimTt+fsUsHiU+8Sgg1hhKstPvL_k+GywuyO6sDX@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Thanks to Karl for the swift reply for my last retarded question (how to
fail from java strategies).

Because my analysis for generating warnings is quite slow, I want to disable
real-time analysis and have it run on demand (eg from a spoofax builder).  I
can't find any eclipse or spoofax settings to do this.  I discovered the
set-markers(|ast) strategy in lib/editor-common.generated.str, and thought I
could call it from a builder.  Unfortunately this approach hasn't work out
as I hoped.  This is my current attempt:

in FSMdsl-Builders.esv -

builder                   : "Check transitions (for selection)" =
check-transitions

And the corresponding strategy:

check-transitions:
        (selected, position, ast, path, project-path) ->
            < ?x; where(<set-markers(|ast)>(ast, [], warnings, [])); !x
>(filename, result)
        with
            filename := <guarantee-extension(|"msf")> path;
            warnings := <collect-all(condition-warning, conc)> ast;
            result := <map(to-dimacs)><collect-om(trans-to-cnf)>selected

Any suggestions how to generate markers on demand only?

Cheers,

Shannon

Thought I should probably mention what the problem with my current attempt
actually is - I'm getting this exception:

org.spoofax.interpreter.core.InterpreterException: Wrong term arity when
calling 'SSL_EXT_set_markers', expected 2 got 1
    at org.spoofax.interpreter.stratego.PrimT.eval(PrimT.java:54)

    at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)

If term arity refers to the number of term arguments, that's weird because
the strategy is defined as
set-markers(|ast) = prim("SSL_EXT_set_markers", ast)
in editor-common.generated.str

But it does look like the actual primitive strategy does want two term
arguments, if my guess is correct:

package org.strategoxt.imp.runtime.stratego;

SetMarkersPrimitive extends AbstractPrimitive {

	public SetMarkersPrimitive() {
		super("SSL_EXT_set_markers", 0, 2);
	}

This is right.

> 	}

This is wrong. The SetMarkersPrimitive#call() method in only needs
tvars[0], i.e. one term argument.

You could try this as a temporary workaround:

my-set-markers(|ast) = prim("SSL_EXT_set_markers", ast, None())

              10th International Workshop on 
      Reduction Strategies in Rewriting and Programming 
          http://www.dsic.upv.es/workshops/wrs2011
               29 May 2011, Novi Sad, Serbia

                  An RDP 2011 workshop 
Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and Programming


This workshop promotes research and collaboration in the area of 
reduction strategies. It encourages the presentation of new 
directions, developments, and results as well as surveys and 
tutorials on existing knowledge in this area. Reduction strategies 
define which (sub)expression(s) should be selected for evaluation 
and which rule(s) should be applied. These choices affect fundamental 
properties of computations such as laziness, strictness, completeness, 
and efficiency, to name a few. For this reason programming languages 
such as Elan, Maude, OBJ, Stratego, and TOM allow the explicit 
definition of the evaluation strategy, whereas languages such as 
Clean, Curry, and Haskell allow its modification. In addition to 
strategies in rewriting and programming, WRS also covers the use of 
strategies and tactics in other areas such as theorem and termination 
proving. 

Previous editions of the workshop were held in Utrecht (2001), 
Copenhagen (2002), Valencia (2003), Aachen (2004), Nara (2005), 
Seattle (2006), Paris (2007), Hagenberg (2008), Brasilia (2009), 
and Edinburgh (2010); the last one as a joint workshop with the 
STRATEGIES workshop. Further information can be found at the 
permanent site for WRS <http://www.dsic.upv.es/~wrs/>.

WRS 2011 is planned to be co-located with RTA 2011 (22nd International 
Conference on Rewriting Techniques and Applications), as a satellite 
event of RDP, the Federated Conference on Rewriting, Deduction, and 
Programming. WRS 2011 will be held at Novi Sad, Serbia on 29 May 2011.

Submissions and Publication: Before the workshop, authors are 
invited to submit an extended abstract (max. 5 pages) to be 
formatted in the EasyChair class style through the EasyChair submission site. 
Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop and included in the 
preliminary proceedings, available at the workshop. After the workshop, 
authors will be invited to submit a full paper of their presentation 
(typically a 15-pages paper), which will be refereed and considered 
for publication in an electronic journal, such as Electronic Proceedings 
in Theoretical Computer Science. 

Beyond original ideas and recent results not published nor submitted 
elsewhere, we also invite authors to submit a 5-pages abstract 
describing relevant work that has been or will be published elsewhere, 
or work in progress. These submissions will be only considered for 
presentation at the workshop and inclusion in the preliminary 
proceedings but not in the final proceedings.

We envisage publication of a special issue of a journal dedicated to WRS
after the event.

Hello there,

recently I was playing around with the spoofax language workbench.
It is a lot of fun and I enjoyed the rapid results that i got with 
little effort.
I'm really happy that I found spoofax.

There is only one thing I'm really missing:
An introduction into the term rewriting language. Some functional
programming lectures from the past helped a lot, but couldn't help
with every problem (like a simple recursion over a list). Also having a
look into the libraries weren't helpful enough. I'm sure you have
something like it, it's just I can not find it.

Thanks in advance,

Jochen

Hi Jochen,

The documentation for Stratego can be found here:

http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/StrategoDocumentation

It may take two or three days to work through that, but well worth it.

Another useful resource is the API:

http://releases.strategoxt.org/docs/api/libstratego-lib/stable/docs/

I recommend installing the Stratego Shell also.

-=-=-=-=-=

Onward! 2011
ACM Conference on New Ideas in Programming and Reflections on Software
October 22-27, 2011
Hilton Portland & Executive Tower, Portland, Oregon USA
Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN

http://onward-conference.org/2011/
http://onward-conference.org/2011/poster.html

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other
conferences to not (yet) so well-proven but well-argued ideas. We
welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting
on programming language and software engineering research.

Onward! fosters the multidisciplinarity of software development. We
are interested in anything to do with programming and software.
Processes, methods, languages, art, philosophy, biology, economics,
communities, politics, ethics, and of course applications. Anything!

Sounds good? Do you want to report on and present your new ideas to
the community and get feedback? Do you have a video to show or a story
to tell, an essay perhaps? Do you want to bring reflections and new
insights to the community? Or do you simply want to know more about
innovations, visions, and the future of programming languages and
software engineering? Then...

Join Onward!, the unique, creative, and collaborative environment to
discuss and investigate challenging problems related to software, its
creation, and nurturing.

Betreff: [Stratego Users] Overview of Stratego Syntax

Hello there,

recently I was playing around with the spoofax language workbench.
It is a lot of fun and I enjoyed the rapid results that i got with 
little effort.
I'm really happy that I found spoofax.

There is only one thing I'm really missing:
An introduction into the term rewriting language. Some functional
programming lectures from the past helped a lot, but couldn't help
with every problem (like a simple recursion over a list). Also having a
look into the libraries weren't helpful enough. I'm sure you have
something like it, it's just I can not find it.

Thanks in advance,

Jochen

#################################################################

Modeling and Simulation (M&S) is increasingly becoming a central
activity in the design of new systems and in the analysis of
existing systems because it enables designers and researchers to
investigate systems behavior through virtual representations. For
this reason, M&S is gaining a primary role in many industrial and
research fields, such as space, critical infrastructures,
manufacturing, emergency management, biomedical systems and
sustainable future. However, as the complexity of the
investigated systems increases and the types of investigations
widens, the cost of M&S activities increases for the more
complex models and for the communications among a wider number and
variety of M&S stakeholders (e.g., sub-domain experts, simulator
users, simulator engineers, and final system users). To address
the increasing costs of M&S activities, collaborative
technologies must be introduced to support these activities by
fostering the sharing and reuse of models, by facilitating the
communications among M&S stakeholders, and more generally by
integrating processes, tools and platforms.

Aside from seeking applications of collaborative technologies to
M&S activities, the track seeks innovative contributions that
deal with the application of M&S practices to the design of
collaborative environments. These environments are continuously
becoming more complex, and therefore their design requires
 systematic approaches to meet the required quality of
collaboration. This is important for two reasons: to reduce
rework activities on the actual collaborative environment, and to
maximize the productivity and the quality of the process the
collaborative environment supports. M&S offers the methodologies
and tools for such investigations and therefore it can be used to
improve the quality of collaborative environments.

A non?exhaustive list of topics of interest includes:

* collaborative environments for M&S
* collaborative Systems of Systems M&S
* workflow modelling for collaborative environments and processes
* agent-based M&S
* collaborative distributed simulation
* collaborative component-based M&S
* net-centric M&S
* web-based M&S
* model sharing and reuse
* model building and evaluation
* modeling and simulation of business processes
* modeling for collaboration
* simulation-based performance evaluation of collaborative networks
* model-driven simulation engineering
* domain specific languages for the simulation of collaborative environments
* domain specific languages for collaborative M&S
* databases and repositories for M&S
* distributed virtual environments
* virtual research environment for M&S

To stimulate creativity, however, the track maintains a wider
scope and invites interested researchers to present contributions
that offer original perspectives on collaboration and M&S.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
On-Line Submissions and Publication

tables and references) can be submitted. Papers should follow the
IEEE format, which is single spaced, two columns, 10 pt
Times/Roman font. All submissions should be electronic (in PDF)
and will be peer-reviewed by at least three program committee
members.

Accepted full papers will be included in the proceedings and
 published by the IEEE Computer Society Press (IEEE
approval pending). Please note that at least one author for each
accepted paper should register to attend WETICE 2011 to have the
paper published in the proceedings.

Authors may contact the organizers for expression of interests
and content appropriateness at any time. Papers can be submitted
in PDF format at the submission site
(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=comets2011), which is
supported by the EasyChair conference management system. Please
contact the track chairs (comets2011 at easychair.org) if you
experience problems with the EasyChair Web site.
