---------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE

Software Language Engineering (SLE) is the application of systematic,
disciplined, and measurable approaches to the development, use, deployment,
and maintenance of software languages. The term "software language" is used
broadly, and includes: general-purpose programming languages;
domain-specific languages (e.g. BPMN, Simulink, Modelica); modeling and
metamodeling languages (e.g. SysML and UML); data models and ontologies
(e.g. XML-based and OWL-based languages and vocabularies).

---------------------------------------------------------
TOPICS OF INTEREST

SLE aims to be broad-minded and inclusive about relevance and scope. We
solicit high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and
conceptual contributions to tools, techniques, and frameworks. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Approaches and methodologies for language design
- Tools for language design and implementation (incl. meta-languages,
meta-tools, language workbenches)
- Generative approaches (incl. transformation and transformation languages,
code generation)
- Interpreters and interpreter composition
- Techniques for analysing (and proving properties of) software language
descriptions
- Techniques for software language reuse, evolution and management of
variations (syntactic/semantic) within language families
- Integration and coordination of disparate software languages and tools
- Applications of DSLs for different purposes  (incl. modeling, simulating,
generation, description, checking)
- Novel applications and/or empirical studies on any aspect of SLE
(development, use, deployment, and maintenance of software languages)
- Cross-fertilization of different technological spaces (e.g. modelware,
grammarware, ontologies)

---------------------------------------------------------
TYPES OF SUBMISSIONS

- Research papers: These should report a substantial research contribution
to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or both. Full paper
submissions must not exceed 12 pages (in ACM SIGPLAN conference style).
- Tool papers: Because of SLE's ample interest in tools, we seek papers
that present software tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria
include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to
SLE. Tool papers should include an appendix outlining the proposed
demonstration, including screenshots etc. A short video may be linked as
well. Tool paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages (in ACM SIGPLAN
conference style).
- Bridging position papers: These papers discuss bridging ideas from the
different areas of SLE (e.g. modelling, programming languages, grammars,
etc). This includes both foundational ideas and/or practical techniques.
Bridging position papers must not exceed 2 pages (in ACM SIGPLAN conference
style).

In 2015, industrial experience papers should be submitted to the ITSLE
workshop.

Papers should follow the  ACM SIGPLAN conference style,  10 point font:
http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/

Note that by default the SIGPLAN Proceedings Format produces papers in 9
point font by default. If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you
will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are
formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word
template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your
submission; setting the preprint option in the LaTeX \documentclass command
generates page numbers. Please also ensure that your submission is legible
when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that
colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.

Submitted articles must not have been previously published or currently be
submitted for publication elsewhere. The program chairs will apply the
principles of the ACM Plagiarism Policy throughout the submission and
review process.

---------------------------------------------------------
PUBLICATIONS

All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the
program committee. Authors will be given a brief opportunity for a reply to
the reviews. The replies will be considered in the PC's discussions, and
considered in the selection of the best reviewer. All accepted papers will
be published in ACM Digital Library.

Authors of best papers from the conference will be invited to revise and
submit extended versions of their papers for a Journal special issue.

---------------------------------------------------------
AWARDS

- Best paper. Award for best overall paper, as determined by the PC chairs
based on the recommendations of the programme committee.
- Best presentation. Award for the best paper presentation. We want to
encourage well structured and lively presentations. Determined by the
audience.
- Best reviewer. Award for best reviewer, as determined by the PC chairs
using feedback from the authors.

Subject: [Stratego Users] to many tests
Message-ID: <54CD0C70.6070401@yahoo.com>

Starting with the default setup I added Unicode characters to the
identifier and set up tests for CJK characters.
I also added nesting comments and a few other changes to the default
common.sdf3

I created a spt file with 517 tests each with an entity whose name was
40 characters from CJK.

The parsing never finished for this file.

I broke them out into sepearate files of 100 tests per file but even
when they parsed the test run would never finish discovering tests.

I broke it down into smaller files but that didn't fix the problem until
I had less than 50 tests in the file.
Even at list level the test runner took far longer than it did with
smaller files.

1 test less than a second
10 3 seconds
20 7 seconds
30 18 seconds
40 30 seconds
50 144 seconds
60 137 seconds
70 235 seconds
80 364 seconds
90 1039 seconds

so you can see that there is some kind of poor scaling behavior here.

I suspect the problem is in the parsing of the file since the majority
of the time is before the tests run.

I solved the problem by making the tests bigger now I have 5 files with
1 test each containing 100 entities. one of these runs in ~2 seconds.

Anyway someone might want to look into that.
