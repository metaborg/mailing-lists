Subject: [Stratego Users] no 64-bit stratego-shell package in hydra
Message-ID: <c9757bb60910160407j2b9bf3c7l280f14204e4d06ee@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I can't find a 64-bit build of the stratego-shell to install via nix. I'm
sure I used to have a 64-bit version installed before nix started using
hydra. Am I going to have to download the source to install it, or does
someone know a channel that I can subscribe to that includes the 64-bit
packages?

Cheers,
Rob

Hi users, I am using the Stratego/XT tool with Java-Front for translate
some codes. But I could not made a transformation. It is not difficult,
but I need help.

I have a simple class:

class Fork implements TObject {
        private volatile Boolean fork = true;
}

And I need verify that this class implements the interface 'TObjetc'. If
yes, I include some code after the attribute 'fork':

class Fork implements TObject {
       private volatile Boolean fork = true;
       public getFork () {}
       public setFork () {}
}

I tried made this analyzing the abstract syntax tree generated by the
output of parse-java to the pp-aterm tool. And I create a rule using the
function <equal>  but I could not made the transformation. I think this is
simple, but I do not understand how to make this.

Can you help me?

Do you have any paper that learns how do this?

Hi Marcos,

I am not sure what you mean with '.. And I create a rule using the function <equal>  but I could not made the transformation...'. Could you be a bit more specific on your problems?

I don't think there a real tutorial for Java transformations, but maybe this presentation gives an idea. http://smart-generators.org/M3Visser*
And of course there is the StrategoXT manual which gives explanation of all aspects of StrategoXT architecture and language: http://hydra.nixos.org/job/strategoxt-docs/strategoxt-manual/html/latest/download/1/manual

greetings,
Rob

I did this:

I used the tool pp-aterm to generated the abstract syntax tree of class:

class Fork implements TObject {
    private volatile Boolean fork = true;
}

and the pp-aterm generated:

CompilationUnit(
  None()
, []
, [ ClassDec(
      ClassDecHead(
        []
      , Id("Fork")
      , None()
      , None()
      , Some(ImplementsDec([InterfaceType(TypeName(Id("TObject")), None())]))
      )
    , ClassBody(
        [ FieldDec(
            [Private(), Volatile()]
          , Boolean()
          , [VarDec(Id("fork"), Lit(Bool(True())))]
          )
        ]
      )
    )
  ]
)

Then in my .str, I wrote this rule:

module add-method
imports libstratego-lib libjava-front
strategies

  main =
    io-wrap(add-method)

  add-method =
    topdown(try(AddMethod))

rules

  AddMethod:
   ImplementsDec(e) ->
ImplementsDec([InterfaceType(TypeName(Id("TObject")), None())])
     where <equal>(e,[InterfaceType(TypeName(Id("TObject")), None())])


Ok. This is simple, but I need verify that the class implements the
interface TObject. My transformation will be:

Translate this code:

class Fork implements TObject {
    private volatile Boolean fork = true;
}

To this code:

class Fork implements TObject {
    private volatile Boolean fork = true;
    public getFork () {}
    public setFork () {}
}

Do you understand?
