Subject: [Stratego Users] Stratego code for listing all files with a
	specific extension?
Message-ID: <D8F28D41-7313-42D5-84B6-B85E42D1E940@swansea.ac.uk>

Hi,

I'm looking for a strategy that returns the paths of *all* files with a particular extension found anywhere in a hierarchical directory structure. For example, the shell command

	find Dropbox -name "*.jpg" -print

does just what I want for the Dropbox directory and file extension "jpg", printing lines such as

	Dropbox/Photos/Sample Album/Boston City Flow.jpg 
	Dropbox/Photos/Sample Album/Costa Rican Frog.jpg 
	Dropbox/Photos/Sample Album/Pensive Parakeet.jpg 

However, I don't see how to implement that in Stratego using the path and directory operations described in the system/posix library - in particular, the find-file variants there don't appear to do what I want. If something similar has been implemented in some other Stratego library, kindly let me know where to look. I'm using Spoofax, but a novice at Stratego coding.

BTW, my intended use of the above strategy is to automate the application of a Spoofax menu action to a large collection of source files. For various reasons, I'd prefer to avoid scripting this using the Spoofax command-line interface.

Thanks,

Peter

Hi Peter,

I do not remember seeing a strategy that does this (although i do recall implementing this but i cannot find it anywhere). I think this could be implemented concisely in Java as an external strategy. We have a bit of documentation on how to write such a strategy at http://metaborg.org/stratego/external-strategies/. I hope this helps, let me know if you get stuck.

Vlad

Hi Peter,

Have a look at
https://github.com/webdsl/webdsl/blob/master/src/org/webdsl/dsl/utils/traverse.str

You can just copy those strategies to your project, example usage:

transform-files =

  getcwd

; traverse-files(try(transform-file))

transform-file =

  string-ends-with(|".str")

; debug

Hi Danny and Vlad,

Many thanks for the helpful responses.

The Stratego solution fits my intended usage very nicely, so I'll try with that.
