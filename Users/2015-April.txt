Subject: [Stratego Users] DSLDI: 3rd Workshop on Domain-Specific Language
	Design and Implementation (EXTENDED DEADLINE)
Message-ID: <E6A23026-5DC5-4520-BD3D-B187FEC7DCF6@cwi.nl>

*********************************************************************
SECOND CALL FOR TALK PROPOSALS

DSLDI 2015

Third Workshop on
Domain-Specific Language Design and Implementation

July 7, 2015
Prague, Czech Republic
Co-located with ECOOP

http://2015.ecoop.org/track/dsldi-2015-papers
*********************************************************************

EXTENDED Deadline for talk proposals: 9th of April, 2015

If designed and implemented well, domain-specific languages (DSLs) combine the best features of general-purpose programming languages (e.g., performance) with high productivity (e.g., ease of programming).

*** Workshop Goal ***

The goal of the DSLDI workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in sharing ideas on how DSLs should be designed, implemented, supported by tools, and applied in realistic application contexts. We are both interested in discovering how already known domains such as graph processing or machine learning can be best supported by DSLs, but also in exploring new domains that could be targeted by DSLs. More generally, we are interested in building a community that can drive forward the development of modern DSLs.

*** Workshop Format ***

DSLDI is a single-day workshop and will consist of a series of short talks whose main goal is to trigger exchange of opinion and discussions. The talks should be on the topics within DSLDI's area of interest, which include but are not limited to the following ones:

* DSL implementation techniques, including compiler-level and runtime-level solutions
* utilization of domain knowledge for driving optimizations of DSL implementations
* utilizing DSLs for managing parallelism and hardware heterogeneity
* DSL performance and scalability studies
* DSL tools, such as DSL editors and editor plugins, debuggers, refactoring tools, etc.
* applications of DSLs to existing as well as emerging domains, for
  example graph processing, image processing, machine learning, analytics, robotics, etc.
* practitioners reports, for example descriptions of DSL deployment i  a real-life production setting

*** Call for Submissions ***

We solicit talk proposals in the form of short abstracts (max. 2 pages). A good talk proposal describes an interesting position, demonstration, or early achievement. The submissions will be reviewed on relevance and clarity, and used to plan the mostly interactive sessions of the workshop day. Publication of accepted abstracts and slides on the website is voluntary.

* _EXTENDED_ Deadline for talk proposals: April 9th, 2015
* Notification: May 8th, 2015
* Workshop: July 7th, 2015

                       CALL FOR PAPERS

                           WGP 2015

        11th ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Generic Programming
                      Vancouver, Canada
                    Sunday, August 30, 2015

                http://www.wgp-sigplan.org/2015

                      Co-located with the
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2015)
======================================================================


Goals of the workshop
---------------------

Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making
them more general. Generic programs often embody non-traditional kinds
of polymorphism; ordinary programs are obtained from them by suitably
instantiating their parameters. In contrast with normal programs, the
parameters of a generic program are often quite rich in structure; for
example they may be other programs, types or type constructors, class
hierarchies, or even programming paradigms.

Generic programming techniques have always been of interest, both to
practitioners and to theoreticians, and, for at least 20 years,
generic programming techniques have been a specific focus of research
in the functional and object-oriented programming communities. Generic
programming has gradually spread to more and more mainstream
languages, and today is widely used in industry. This workshop brings
together leading researchers and practitioners in generic programming
from around the world, and features papers capturing the state of the
art in this important area.

We welcome contributions on all aspects, theoretical as well as
practical, of

* generic programming,
* programming with (C++) concepts,
* meta-programming,
* programming with type classes,
* programming with modules,
* programming with dependent types,
* type systems for generic programming,
* polytypic programming,
* adaptive object-oriented programming,
* component-based programming,
* strategic programming,
* aspect-oriented programming,
* family polymorphism,
* object-oriented generic programming,
* implementation of generic programming languages,
* static and dynamic analyses of generic programs,
* and so on.

We plan to have formal proceedings, published by the ACM. Accepted
papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors must grant
ACM publication rights upon acceptance
(http://authors.acm.org/main.html), but may retain copyright if they
wish. Authors are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their
paper (source code, test data, and so forth). The proceedings will be
freely available for download from the ACM Digital Library from one
week before the start of the conference until two weeks after the
conference.

Submission details
------------------

* Submission deadline:  Fri, 15th May 2015
* Author notification:  Fri, 26th June 2015
* Final version due:    Sun, 19th July 2015
* Workshop:             Sun, 30th August 2015

Submitted papers should fall into one of two categories:

* Regular research papers (12 pages)
* Short papers: case studies, tool demos, generic pearls (6 pages)

Regular research papers are expected to present novel and interesting
research results. Short papers need not present novel or fully polished
results. Good candidates for short papers are those that report on 
interesting case studies of generic programming in open source or 
industry, present demos of generic programming tools or libraries, 
or discuss elegant and illustrative uses of generic programming ('pearls').

All submissions should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted
using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines (two-column, 9pt). Regular 
research papers must not exceed 12 pages. Short papers must not exceed 
6 pages. If applicable, papers should be marked with one of the labels
'case study, 'tool demo' or 'generic pearl' in the title at the time 
of submission.

Papers should be submitted via HotCRP at

https://icfp-wgp15.hotcrp.com/



Travel Support
--------------

Student attendees with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC grant
to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such as
for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC program, see its web page (http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).
