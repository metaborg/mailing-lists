Subject: [Stratego Users] JDK version for Dryad
Message-ID: <000301c9d2dd$6fad3f00$ad0ca8c0@CSE.local>

Hi, 

I notice that on the Dryad page, http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/TheDryad it
mentions that JDK 5.0 is required when building Dryad from source. However,
from the configuration log of the latest integrated release it appears JDK
6.0 is required.

http://releases.strategoxt.org/dryad/dryad-0.2pre1835518355-zbqfh1rm/1-sourc
e-tarball-logs-3_configurePhase.html

 

Does the web page need to be updated?

 

Thanks

Diarmuid Flynn

Subject: [Stratego Users] Refactoring Precondition Checker -  using Dryad
Message-ID: <000d01c9d47b$a3fea3d0$7a01010a@CSE.local>

Hi, I am trying to write a precondition and postcondition checker for
automated refactorings using Dryad. At the moment I am trying to read input
from a Java source file. I am basing my code on the dryad-front module, I
hope to have all dryad-front input options available in my tool also. 

 

The tool calls dryad-front first and then will use the output from
dryad-front  as input to a strategy which will check for refactoring
preconditions. 

I would like to be able to check for preconditions by running : "checker -i
Foo.java" and also have the ability to call "checker Foo -O Foo.class",
basically use same input options as dryad-front.

 

Does this seem like a good way of tackling this problem ? (See code below)
I have had some issues in getting this to work, but before I get into all of
that, I just want to make sure that  my general approach is correct.  Any
advice would be much appreciated.

 

Thank you 

Diarmuid Flynn

Sure, it looks reasonable to me. It looks like the standard template
for a Java transformation tool based on Dryad, and you can add
anything to the pipeline you want, which includes pre/post condition
checkers.

Martin, thanks for that. When I sent this question in last week, I was
having trouble getting this "template" to work in a tool I built myself.

However the problem was related to having a different version of gcc on my
$PATH, than the version of gcc installed with NIX. So when I built my tool
it wouldn't run properly when using certain Dryad library functions. 

Regards,
Diarmuid Flynn

This is a know problem and it's pretty ugly, too.

$ CC=$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/gcc ./configure ....

usually solves this problem by using the gcc provided by Nix instead of 
the one supplied by your distro.
