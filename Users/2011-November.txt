Subject: [Stratego Users] Question about Postfix expressions with guarded
	children
Message-ID: <CAFu+mo+wDev5Fo6E53iqbKtok5SHoHAA2MA+kk7oBKqLHCT6tg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been playing with postfix expressions with guarded children and the
only examples that I could find, are a bit restrictive:
context-free priorities
{
   E "[" E "]" -> E
} <0> > {
   E "+" E -> E {left}
}
This means that <0> is applied to the productions of the entire block.
Is there any way to specify guards only for specific rules?
I tried writing:
E "[" E "]" -> E {0}, but this is not handled by Spoofax and I get weird
errors from the editor (even though it generates table somehow).

Thanks,
Radu Mereuta

Hi Radu,

I have no firsthand experience with this notation, but I do know that 
you can write

   context-free priorities
      E "[" E "]" -> E <0> >
      E "+" E -> E {left}

leaving out the grouping. And if you add {0} to a rule, then you're only 
annotating it with the term '0', which has no real meaning to the parser.

hth,

Lennart

Hi Radu, hi Lennart,

according to http://homepages.cwi.nl/~daybuild/daily-books/syntax/2-sdf/sdf.pdf (Page 18) the number between the angled brackets was used to "indicates to which arguments the disambiguation should be applied (and implicitly in which not)". I'm not sure if this still holds for SDF in Spoofax.

In case it does not, you can fix such things with injection rules

context-free syntax

  E -> IndexE

context-free priorities
    E "[" IndexE "]" -> E  >
    E "+" E -> E {left}

Hi again,

I was actually interested in how could I apply that exception to specific
productions, not to an entire block, but injecting new rules might do the
trick. Thanks.
Annotating blocks still works in Spoofax, but let me know if you can still
annotate only specific rules. I haven't been able to find the correct
syntax.

My problem was that I don't know how to apply the guard to this example:

context-free priorities
{
     Exp "[" Exp "]" -> Exp {cons("Array")} %% <0>
     "if" Exp "then" Exp -> Exp {cons("If")} %% <1>
} > {
     Exp "*" Exp -> Exp {left, cons("Mull")}
} > {
     Exp "+" Exp -> Exp {left, cons("Add")}
}

The only way I managed to make it to work was like this:
context-free priorities
{
     Exp "[" Exp "]" -> Exp {cons("Array")} %% <0>
     "if" Exp "then" Exp -> Exp {cons("If")} %% <1>
} <0> > { %% specify the guard for the entire block
     Exp "*" Exp -> Exp {left, cons("Mull")}
} > {
     Exp "+" Exp -> Exp {left, cons("Add")}
}
All my other tries ended up with parse errors, and I couldn't find any
example with more than two productions.
Should I write them in pairs? Or should I repeat only the rules where the
priority filter is suppressed?

I am trying to get a deeper understanding of the SDF syntax.

Thanks,
Radu

Hi Radu,

Aha. Now I get it! This is the solution, ugly as it may be:

context-free priorities
{
 ? ? ?Exp "[" Exp "]" -> Exp {cons("Array")}
 ? ? ?"if" Exp "then" Exp -> Exp {cons("If")}
} <0,3>
> Exp "*" Exp -> Exp {left, cons("Mull")}
> Exp "+" Exp -> Exp {left, cons("Add")}

This restricts the priority filter to the first and third arguments of
Array and If. Since Array does not have a recursive third argument and
If does not have a  recursive first argument the restriction 0 does
not have an effect on If and the restriction 3 does not have an effect
on Array. (not tested!)

Some unsolicited feedback on language design: I suspect people will
find it unexpected to see Array's and If's with the same priority
level. Also, it is still ambiguous for the input "if a then b [ c ]",
since the array index could be applied to "if a then b" or only to b.
Usually, "If" has the lowest priority in the (partial) ordering of
expression operators.

Cheers,

Jurgen

This was just an example that came off the top of my head, I don't really
have this in my language. Although we might, if the users decides to write
something like this in our K-framework (even though weird like you just
mentioned). I was just experimenting to see the limitations of the tool.

Hi Radu,

Ah, in that case I should not have advised anything. My bad. Anyway, I
hope this answer helped.

Cheers,

Jurgen

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? CALL FOR PAPERS

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2nd International Workshop on
? ? ? Model-driven Approaches for Simulation Engineering
?part of the Symposium on Theory of Modeling and Simulation
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?(SCS SpringSim 2012)

#####################################################################

March 26-29, 2012, Orlando, FL (USA)

# Papers Due: *** December 6, 2011 ****** Extended
# Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and
archived
# in the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplorer and IEEE CS Digital
Library.
# The Symposium is co-sponsored by IEEE.
#####################################################################

The workshop aims to bring together experts in model-based, model-
driven and software engineering with experts in simulation methods and
simulation practitioners, with the objective to advance the state of
the art in model-driven simulation engineering.

Model-driven engineering approaches provide considerable advantages to
software systems engineering activities through the provision of
consistent and coherent models at different abstraction levels. As
these models are in a machine readable form, model-driven engineering
approaches can also support the exploitation of computing capabilities
for model reuse, programming code generation, and model checking, for
example.

The definition of a simulation model, its software implementation and
its execution platform form what is known as simulation engineering.
As simulation systems are mainly based on software, these systems can
similarly benefit from model-driven approaches to support automatic
software generation, enhance software quality, and reduce costs,
development effort and time-to-market.

Similarly to systems and software engineering, simulation engineering
can exploit the capabilities of model-driven approaches by increasing
the abstraction level in simulation model specifications and by
automating the derivation of simulator code. Further advantages can be
gained by using modeling languages, such as UML and SysML ? but not
exclusively those. For example, modeling languages can be used for
descriptive modeling (to describe the system to be simulated), for
analytical modeling (to specify analytically the simulation of the
same system), and for implementation modeling (to define the
respective simulator).

A partial list of topics of interest includes:

* model-driven simulation engineering processes
* requirements modeling for simulation
* domain specific languages for modeling and simulation
* model transformations for simulation model building
* model transformations for simulation model implementation
* model-driven engineering of distributed simulation systems
* relationship between metamodeling standards (e.g., MOF, Ecore) and
distributed simulation standards (e.g., HLA, DIS)
* metamodels for simulation reuse and interoperability
* model-driven technologies for different simulation paradigms
(discrete event simulation, multi-agent simulation, sketch-based *
simulation, etc.)
* model-driven methods and tools for performance engineering of
simulation systems

We invite paper submissions in three forms:

1. Full paper (max 8 pages), describing innovative research results.
These papers are eligible for the best paper award and may be invited
for an extended version in a special issue of the SCS SIMULATION
journal.
2. Work-in-progress paper (max 6 pages), describing novel research
ideas and promising work that have not yet been fully evaluated.
3. Short paper (max 6 pages), describing industrial and hands-on
experience on any relevant area (i.e. military, government, space,
etc.).

All the papers must be submitted through the SCS conference management
systems (http://www.softconf.com/scs/DEVS12/), selecting the Mod4Sim
track in the "Submission Categories" section. All the submitted papers
must be in PDF format and must conform to the SCS conference template
(Word template is available at
http://www.scs.org/upload/documents/templates/ConferenceSubmissionWORDTemplate.doc
, guidelines are available athttp://www.scs.org/PDFs/formattingkit.pdf).
All the submitted papers must be original and not submitted else
where. Submitted papers will be peer reviewed with respect to their
quality, originality and relevance. The authors of the accepted papers
must register in advance for inclusion of their paper in the
conference proceedings. Authors of accepted papers will be invited to
update their papers basing on the reviews, before providing the camera
ready.

All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and
archived in the ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplorer and IEEE CS Digital
Library. However, **only** accepted **full papers** will be printed in
hard copy.

Authors may contact the organizers for expression of interest and
content appropriateness at any time.

Due to numerous requests, we have extended the deadline for submission
of papers. In order to expedite the review process, authors must
submit an abstract and information about the paper/authors in the
submission system before November 25, 2011. The paper should be
uploaded into the system before December 6, 2011.
