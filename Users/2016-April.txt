========================================================================

Software Language Engineering (SLE) is the application of systematic,
disciplined, and measurable approaches to the development, use, deployment,
and maintenance of software languages. The term "software language" is used
broadly, and includes: general-purpose programming languages;
domain-specific languages (e.g. BPMN, Simulink, Modelica); modeling and
metamodeling languages (e.g. SysML and UML); data models and ontologies
(e.g. XML-based and OWL-based languages and vocabularies).

### Topics of Interest

SLE aims to be broad-minded and inclusive about relevance and scope. We
solicit high-quality contributions in areas ranging from theoretical and
conceptual contributions to tools, techniques, and frameworks in the domain
of language engineering. Topics relevant to SLE cover generic aspects of
software languages development rather than aspects of engineering a
specific language. In particular, SLE is interested in principled
engineering approaches and techniques in the following areas:

* Language Design and Implementation
    * Approaches and methodologies for language design
    * Static semantics (e.g., design rules, well-formedness constraints)
    * Techniques for behavioral / executable semantics
    * Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation)
    * Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches

* Language Validation
    * Verification and formal methods for languages
    * Testing techniques for languages
    * Simulation techniques for languages

* Language Integration
    * Coordination between of heterogeneous languages and tools
    * Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages)
    * Traceability between languages
    * Deployment of languages to different platforms

* Language Maintenance
    * Software language reuse
    * Language evolution
    * Language families and variability

* Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design,
implementation, validation, maintenance)

* Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools
    * User studies evaluating usability
    * Performance benchmarks
    * Industrial applications


### Types of Submissions

* **Research papers**: These should report a substantial research
contribution to SLE or successful application of SLE techniques or both.
Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography (in
ACM SIGPLAN conference style (http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/)).

* **Tool papers**: Because of SLE?s interest in tools, we seek papers that
present software tools related to the field of SLE. Selection criteria
include originality of the tool, its innovative aspects, and relevance to
SLE. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool
demonstrations. Submissions must provide a tool description of 4 pages in
SIGPLAN proceedings style (see above), with 1 optional additional page for
bibliographic references, and a demonstration outline including screenshots
of up to 4 pages. Tool demonstrations must have the keywords "Tool Demo" or
?Tool Demonstration? in the title. The 4-page tool description will, if the
demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings. The 4-page
demonstration outline will be used by the program committee only for
evaluating the submission.


### Artifact evaluation

Authors of accepted papers at SLE 2016 are encouraged to submit their
experiment results used for underpinning research statements to an artifact
evaluation process carried out in early September 2016. This submission is
voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.

Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully receive
a seal of approval printed on the first page of the paper in the
proceedings. Authors of papers with accepted artifacts are encouraged to
make these materials publicly available upon publication of the
proceedings, by including them as "source materials" in the ACM Digital
Library.


### Publications

All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the
program committee. All accepted papers, including tool papers will be
published in ACM Digital Library.

Authors of distinguished papers from the conference will be invited to
revise and submit extended versions of their papers for a Journal special
issue.


### Awards

* Distinguished paper. Award for most notable paper, as determined by the
PC chairs based on the recommendations of the program committee.

* Distinguished reviewer. Award for distinguished reviewer, as determined
by the PC chairs using feedback from the authors.
