Subject: [Stratego Users] Spoofax 1.2 released
Message-ID: <CAOipTujuG=hUHZpvOL+jweetEECCZNdhvJGo0LD1cg7rDmoAQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We're happy to announce the release of Spoofax 1.2! Have a look at our
change log at
https://github.com/metaborg/doc/blob/master/releases/spoofax/1.2.md for the
changes in Spoofax 1.2.

You can install or update to Spoofax 1.2 in Eclipse using the regular
stable update site: http://download.spoofax.org/update/stable/. If you
would like to downgrade to Spoofax 1.1 again after installing 1.2, you can
uninstall Spoofax and install from update site:
http://download.spoofax.org/update/release/1.1.

Cheers,
Gabriel

Hi Eduardo,

Great that Spoofax 1.2 has now been released! Also the accompanying documentation for the new features introduced by the previous unstable releases and nightly builds is much appreciated.

However, it appears that 1.2 doesn't include the Lift to SDF3 (concrete) builder that you'd implemented to produce an SDF3 grammar with regular productions (i.e., no templates) from an SDF2 grammar. Please let me know whether I've overlooked some way to do that (or to generate regular productions directly from SDF3 templates). If not, I'll continue to use the unstable release along with your symbolsorts project for migrating my SDF2 grammars to SDF3 regular productions.

Best regards,

Peter

Hi Peter, 

Good to know they are being helpful. When we decided to move to SDF3, we had in mind that would be useful to have such conversion tools to support users that were still using SDF2.
I have been working on refactoring the ant files the last few days, so we could drop some tools that were being called in the previous implementation, e.g., the signature generator from .rtg files.
Hopefully they will be added to Spoofax soon, so the build process is gonna be a little more quick.

I will fix the Format (abstract) builder as soon as possible. I was using it to keep track of the changes that I was doing on the AST and it was defined just for developing purposes. I think I had it working, but
I changed it at some point, and did not change it back.

Yes, it is a good idea to have a builder to extract regular productions from templates. It should be straightforward to do it as well. I will work to have it done by the end of the week and commit it to github.

I really appreciate your feedback, please let me know if there is something else you found interesting to have implemented on it.

Best regards,

I've noticed what seems to be a minor bug: When editing an SDF3 grammar, the new Format (abstract) builder generates concrete SDF3 text in the .aterm file, instead of the expected abstract syntax. The other builders appear to work OK. 

In particular, I'm happy to see that when editing an SDF2 grammar, the Lift to SDF3 (concrete) builder produces an SDF3 grammar with regular productions (i.e., no templates). To convert an SDF3 grammar using templates to regular productions, however, it seems I need to first generate SDF2, then use Lift to SDF3 (concrete) ? could you perhaps add a builder for doing that in one go?

Many thanks for making it so easy to migrate from SDF2 to SDF3!

Best regards,

Peter

Hi Language Engineers and Spoofax Users,

I have been working for the past few months on a refactored and improved version of SDF3 and I need to get feedback from the users in order to fix errors that may appear before we migrate it. The changelog can be found in https://github.com/metaborg/sdf/blob/symbolsorts/changeLog.md and it covers the main changes we implemented in this new version.

To test it you have to import and build the projects in the symbolsorts branch of metaborg/sdf from github (https://github.com/metaborg/sdf/tree/symbolsorts) and have it opened in the same workspace as your spoofax project.

There are two changes that you also need to do to get it working:

- Point the property 'syntax' to the location 'src-gen/syntax' in build.main.xml file of your project.
(<property name="syntax" location="src-gen/syntax" />)

- Import the main stratego pp file from src-gen/pp in trans/pp.str. The main stratego pp file is the file generated from the main .sdf3 file of your grammar (<MainModule>-pp.str).

Please feel free to reply me if you find something that is not working properly, or even if you have suggestions of improvements that should be implemented.

Best regards,

Hi Peter,

As we were still testing my implementation of SDF3, everything that is in
the symbolsorts branch was not included in Spoofax 1.2, unfortunately. The
builder for SDF2 depends on the new implementation of SDF3, that is why it
was not included in the new release.
However, we are planning on merging it at least into nightly as soon as
possible and include it in a stable release of Spoofax 1.3.

I have just committed some changes into symbolsorts that might be
interesting for you:
- Productive productions can also be used in the Variables section.
- A new builder "Extract productions" that extract productive productions
from templates in .sdf3 files.

We also plan to turn these builders into refactoring tools, so it does not
generate a new .sdf3 file when you run the transformation, and preserve the
comments and layout on the original file.

Please let me know if everything is still working with these changes.

Best regards,

Hi,

Many thanks for the release of Spoofax 1.2! A quick question:

https://github.com/metaborg/doc/blob/master/spoofax/sunshine/sunshine.md states:

> Obtaining Sunshine

The latest release there currently has tag 1.1.1. Will it work also with Spoofax 1.2?

Cheers,

Peter

Hi Peter,

The Sunshine version is not in sync with the Spoofax version (yet). The
1.1.1 version should work with 1.2, but if you run into problems I can look
into it.

Cheers,

Subject: field expr with NaBL/type checking
To: g.d.p.konat at tudelft.nl


Hello,

I have the following DSL:

op foo
  attr1 = "fooattr1"
  attr2 = "fooattr2"

op bar
  attr1 = "barattr1"
  attr2 = "barattr2"

op bogus
  attr1 = "bogusattr1"

op sum = foo | bar | bogus

and at some point I have two variables:
myvar1: foo
myvar2: sum

and an expression with a field use:
myvar1.attr2
myvar2.attr2

my current NaBL code to support this is:
RuleDecl(x, _):
 defines unique Rule x of type Rule(x)
Field(v, x):
 refers to Attr x in Rule r
 where v has type Rule(r)

which works fine for myvar1 of type foo, but doesn't obviously for myvar2
which is a "sum" type.

I'd like to express the fact that for a sum type whenever an attribute is
accessed, each rules in the sum type should have this attribute. I'm
guessing this has to be done in the type system, but I dont know whether or
not something has to be done in NaBL as well.

For the sum/or type, I had started to add the following constructor:

 OrRule.OrRule = < = <RuleRef+; separator=" | ">>
 RuleRef.RuleRef = <<ID>>

That way I can do:
RuleRef(x): refers to Rule x

To make sure the rules in the sum type actually exist, but that doesnt
solve the fact that my OrRule is a list, and I don't know how to process
that with NaBL

(Actually I don't even know how to call stratego strategies in NaBL)

Can anyone enlighten me?

NB: I'm running Spoofax 1.2.0

Message-ID: <E12DCC10-5AAB-4867-9E6F-51ABA4FD717E@fail0verflow.com>

Hello,

since I couldn't get the strategoshell to work with Spoofax 1.2.0 (http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/912) and the learning curve/debugging would definitely be easier with a shell, I'm trying to compile a standalone stratego-shell.

I've compiled successfully a standalone StrategoXT from https://github.com/metaborg/strategoxt
but now I have difficulties finding instructions to get and compile a matching version of stratego-shell.

the link ftp://ftp.strategoxt.org/pub/stratego/StrategoXT/strategoxt-0.17/stratego-shell-0.7.tar.gz
from http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/StrategoShellRelease07 seems down.

I could svn checkout https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/stratego-shell/branches/stratego-shell-0.7/
but then it seems to require autoxt? And I'm not sure that's the proper path of actions.

Could someone help me getting either the Spoofax console to work or a standalone strategoshell?

Papers that address any aspect of software development are welcome,
including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation,
generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance,
reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems. Papers may address
these topics in a variety of ways, including new tools (such as languages,
program analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as
methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and
management techniques), and new evaluations (such as formalisms and proofs,
corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).

** Onward! Research Papers **
Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to
do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages,
communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and
more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet
proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and
reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

** Onward! Essays **
Onward! Essays is looking for clear and compelling pieces of writing about
topics important to the software community. An essay can be an exploration
of a topic, its impact, or the circumstances of its creation; it can
present a personal view of what is, explore a terrain, or lead the reader
in an act of discovery; it can be a philosophical digression or a deep
analysis. It can describe a personal journey, perhaps that by which the
author reached an understanding of such a topic. The subject area should be
interpreted broadly and can include the relationship of software to human
endeavors, or its philosophical, sociological, psychological, historical,
or anthropological underpinnings.

** Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) **
DLS is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to share
knowledge and research on dynamic languages, their implementation, and
applications. The influence of dynamic languages ? from Lisp to Smalltalk
to Python to Javascript ? on real-world practice, and research, continues
to grow. We invite high quality papers reporting original research,
innovative contributions, or experience related to dynamic languages, their
implementation, and applications.

** Wavefront **
The SPLASH Wavefront track is looking for presentations and technology
talks of interest to the software community, particularly to software
professionals working in companies large and small. Wavefront is a forum
for presenting experience reports and tutorials about innovative tools,
technologies, and software practices.

** Panels **
The Panels track offers exciting discussion about topics related to SPLASH.

http://2014.splashcon.org/track/splash2014-panels


** SPLASH-E **
The SPLASH-E track brings together researchers and educators to share
educational results, ideas, and challenges centered in Software and
Programming Languages. Submission formats vary, including papers, tool
demos, lightning talks, challenge-topics for discussion, and suggested
themes for "unconference" sessions.  Help us create an engaging forum for
educational issues related to SPLASH!

** Artifacts **
The Artifact Evaluation process is a service provided by the community to
help authors of accepted papers provide more substantial supplements to
their papers so future researchers can more effectively build on and
compare with previous work. The Artifact Evaluation Committee has been
formed to assess how well paper authors prepare artifacts in support of
such future researchers. Roughly, authors of papers who wish to participate
are invited to submit an artifact that supports the conclusions of the
paper.

http://2014.splashcon.org/track/splash2014-artifacts


** Workshops **
The SPLASH Workshops track will host a variety of high-quality workshops
(14 in total), allowing their participants to meet and discuss research
questions with peers, to mature new and exciting ideas, and to build up
communities and start new collaborations. SPLASH workshops complement the
main tracks of the conference and provide meetings in a smaller and more
specialized setting. Workshops cultivate new ideas and concepts for the
future, optionally recorded in formal proceedings.

http://2014.splashcon.org/track/splash2014-workshops


** Tutorials **
The SPLASH Tutorials track will consist of prestigious tutorials on current
topics in software, systems, and languages research. The scope of the
tutorials is the same as the conference itself: all aspects of software
construction and delivery at the intersection of programming, languages,
and software engineering. The tutorials in particular focus on the nexus
between research and practice, including work that takes inspiration from
or builds connections to areas not commonly considered at SPLASH. Tutorials
should introduce researchers to current research in an area, or show
important new tools that can be used in research.

** Demos **
The SPLASH Demonstrations track is an excellent vehicle for sharing your
latest work with an experienced and technically savvy audience. Live
demonstrations show the impact of software innovation. Demonstrations are
not product sales pitches, but rather an opportunity to highlight, explain,
and present interesting technical aspects of running applications in a
dynamic and highly interactive setting. Presenters are encouraged to
actively solicit feedback from the audience, which should lead to very
interesting and entertaining demonstration sessions.

http://2014.splashcon.org/track/splash2014-demos


** Posters **
The SPLASH Poster track provides an excellent forum for authors to present
their recent or ongoing projects in an interactive setting, and receive
feedback from the community. We invite submissions covering any aspect of
programming, systems, languages and applications. The goal of the poster
session is to encourage and facilitate small groups of individuals
interested in a technical area to gather and interact. It is held early in
the conference, to promote continued discussion among interested parties.
Posters can be independent presentations or associated with one of the
other parts of SPLASH.

** Doctoral Symposium **
The SPLASH Doctoral Symposium provides students with useful guidance for
completing their dissertation research and beginning their research
careers. The Symposium will provide an interactive forum for doctoral
students who have progressed far enough in their research to have a
structured proposal, but will not be defending their dissertation in the
next 12 months.

http://2014.splashcon.org/track/splash2014-ds


** Student Research Competition **
The ACM SIGPLAN Student Research Competition (ACM SRC) is an
internationally-recognized venue that enables undergraduate and graduate
students to experience the research world, share their research results
with other students and SPLASH attendees. The competition has separate
categories for undergraduate and graduate students and awards prizes to the
top three students in each category. The ACM SIGPLAN Student Research
Competition shares the Poster session?s goal to facilitate interaction with
researchers and industry practitioners; providing both sides with the
opportunity to learn of ongoing, current research.
