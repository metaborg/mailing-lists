Subject: [Stratego Users] Command-line builds
Message-ID: <CAEdnT7_LdGxtUidE5O7ztAnxXXjGQAQYRWiZjzv79GWe=v7gMg@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if anyone had any guidance on how to use the build.main.xml
for command-line based Ant builds.  In a project I am working on, not all
team members use Eclipse, but would they want to include my Spoofax project
as part of a bigger Ant based build process.  In looking into this, and it
seems there is some magic that Eclipse uses to amend the classpath to
include all the needed Spoofax jars.  I'm not immediately seeing where this
magic occurs.  Just calling ant -lib ~/eclipse/plugins/ -f build.main.xml
clearly doesn't cut it.  I can piece something together, but I was
wondering if I was missing a simple way to do this.

Thank you,
Brandon

Hi Brandon,

We currently have little experience with building Spoofax projects outside of Eclipse easily. We're planning improvements in this area together with refactoring of the compilers.

Nevertheless, the recipe below should get you closer.

The build.generated.xml file has a target called utils-files. This target needs to be run from Eclipse once, and places required jars locally in the project. The jars are copied from various Spoofax plugins located within the Eclipse installation. To build from command line you would need to include these jars in the classpath. The check-classpath target should succeed if all the required libraries are available.

Additionally you'll need to provide two executables, sdf2table and implodePT. These are shipped with Spoofax and are in ECLIPSE_DIR/plugins/org.strategoxt.imp.nativebundle */. The build file expects these to be in ${build.strategoxt.sdf}/ path, property which is set in build.main.xml to the ${eclipse.spoofaximp.nativeprefix} location. This location is determined at runtime depending on the platform used. In fact the location is nothing more than a path towards the two executables within the ECLIPSE_DIR/plugins/org.strategoxt.imp.nativebundle plugin. You can therefore set the ${build.strategoxt.sdf} property manually in build.main.xml to the nativebundle.

I hope this helps, a bit,

Vlad

That helps, but maybe I am missing a step.  To enable check-classpath to
see these jars, it needs to have the classpath or classpathref that points
to them.  How do I generate a build.generated.xml that will then add this
classpath to the necessary java calls?   There doesn't seem to be a way in
Ant to globally declare a classpath in build.main.xml that all subsequent
java invocations use without prompting.

Thanks,
Brandon

Hi Brandon,

Indeed the targets in build.generated.xml use the default classpath. I've opened an issue (http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/600) for an improvement. For now, you can either invoke ant with the -lib option, or create a target in build.main.xml that calls (using antcall) the building target but passes in your custom classpath as the default. I believe you can pass properties into the callee environment, including an overridden classpath.

Hi,

Is there a way to give path of generated java code manually? I want to
generate two or more java files from a test file and I want to name
them. As far as I know, it only creates one java file with the same name
but with .java extension.

Best regards,
Hilal

I don't use Eclipse either for my project and I use the command line
Stratego to Java compiler, STRJ. To add my own Jars to the equation I had
to change the strj-jar tool (that basically jars the compiled code) to
actually use the runtimecp command.

I could post the fixed strj-jar somewhere if you'd like, not entirely sure
this would help you tho. I myself dont use ant.

Cheers,
Andre

Message-ID: <CAFaCHU1d6OpoCSp7=PAQ+hf+QF6_ms3EK7fRXMugu_HdAPsgFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Spoofax / Stratego users,

We are starting a new cycle of development on the Spoofax Language
Workbench. To start that process we have cleaned up the issue list on
the YellowGrass issue tracker. In the cleaning operation we have
closed a number of issues that seemed fixed or irrelevant. The latter
issues we have tagged aboned:

   http://yellowgrass.org/tag/Spoofax/abandoned

If you disagree with closing any of these issues you can propose to reopen them.

Next we have created a new roadmap covering development in the next
couple of months:

   http://yellowgrass.org/roadmap/Spoofax

Spoofax release 1.1 will include the version of the new Name Binding
Language that is the current unstable release (which has been in wide
use) and a large number of bug fixes and improvements with respect to
the Spoofax 1.0 release. The NBL version in this release may still
have some limitations, but we strive to make its syntax as stable as
possible.

Spoofax release 1.2 will include a new, more complete, implementation
of NBL-based name resolution. We also aim to integrate Sebastian
Erdweg's extension of JSGLR with layout sensitive parsing in this
release.

This release should provide a stable base for users. After this we
will start attacking a number of larger operations, including
maintenance and refactoring operations, which should provide the basis
for further research and innovation.

If there are important issues that you think should be addressed
please submit them to YellowGrass and/or vote for existing issues on
YellowGrass. (You can vote for an issue using the thumbs-up icon on an
issue page.) While we cannot guarantee anything, we will pay more
attention to issues with lots of votes.

cheers,

Hi Eelco,

Je werkdag mag best eerder dan 21.46 eindigen ;)

Maar verder: dit is goed nieuws. Keep up the good work :)

Ik neem binnenkort contact op over Spoofax dan wel Xtext als onze nieuwe
language workbench.
Ik zelf weet het wel, maar er zijn altijd krachten die ondersteuning door
Itemis belangrijker vinden dan technologie.

Dear Spoofax Users,

As of today, YellowGrass, the issue tracker we use for the Spoofax project

   http://yellowgrass.org/project/Spoofax

now also has an experimental (!) Questions and Answers section for projects:

   http://yellowgrass.org/questions/Spoofax

This section can be used to post those issues that are really
questions about application of Spoofax. The extension is fairly basic
and will be extended in the future. But it should already be useable.

Looking forward to your questions,

Subject: [Stratego Users] Global Hash Maps
Message-ID: <CACLuXbKWy62VvGOjK4pKM6fDEJ4M-hErfB-+e8=NJtj=mfPUQw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Is it possible to define global hash maps?

I define a hash map, using
            new-hashtable => variableHashMap

but I want to put something to this hashmap from rule a, and get from this
hashmap from rule b.

When I try to put to hash map, using
               <hashtable-put(|"Key", "Value")> variableHashMap,
I get the error "Variable variableHashMap is not defined".

Can you help me about this thing?

Thank you,
Hilal

The idiomatic way for doing this is to use dynamic rules:

   rule-a =
      ?VarDef(x, t); rules( TypeOf : x -> t )

   rule-b:
      Var(x) -> Var(x{t})
       where <TypeOf> x => t

Eelco,

Maybe its a good idea to advise people to define only one source for a
dynamic rule, code wise. I.e. make a strategy that writes to the dynamic
rule say write-TypeOf= ?(x,t) ; rules(TypeOf: x -> t) and use the
write-TypeOf strategy instead of rules(TypeOf: x -> t) throughout your
code. I have experienced a bug when I defined the same dynamic rule in
different parts of my code and Danny told me he had experienced this before
too. The bug was that the bagof and the bigbagof always yielded empty lists.

Cheers,
Andre

You will not be able to do this through Stratego alone. However, you can
create an external java strategy, import the HybridInterpreter, load the
jar the strategy should be in and invoke it using the name in the string.

Hope that helps ya!

Andre

Hi Dobes,

don't know about a preview build of Spoofax, but you can try out the layout-sensitive parser here: http://parser.sugarj.org
The source code of the parser is here (https://github.com/seba--/layout-parsing/), which Eclipse can easily build for you.

Cheers,
Sebastian

Hi,

I had asked a question about defining globals in stratego. As Dobes
suggested, I defined following:

*set-global = ?(name,value) ; rules(get-global: name -> value)*

And I have following rules

*RuleA(VarName, x)->$[*
*..*
*]*
*where*
*<set-global> (VarName, "abc")*
*
*
*
*
*RuleB(VarName, x, y)->$[*
*..*
*]*
*where*
*bar := <get-global> VarName*

When RuleB runs, I get the error:

HyFlexGeneration: rewriting failed, trace:
generate_java_0_0
to_java_0_0
to_java_0_0
map_1_0

What am I missing?
Thank you,

Hi Hilal,

Probably the <get-global> VarName is applied to a VarName for which no
set-global was done previously. This would lead the get-global to fail. To
verify, change the call to:

 <get-global <+ debug(!"global not set: ")> VarName

cheers,

Subject: [Stratego Users] The Language Designer's Workbench
Message-ID: <CAFaCHU0U3u7TEdNidiY-9NrShccVXRjtrmJ-JcVa36pDxTYSpg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Stratego, Spoofax Community,

It is a great honor that the dutch national science foundation NWO has
awarded my VICI proposal 'The Language Designer's Workbench' to
investigate the building blocks of the next generation of language
workbenches. The essence of the plan is to provide much better support
to language designers by means of deep analyses of language
definitions.

While the VICI grant is a personal grant, I feel it is also an award
for the outstanding work done by theStratego/XT and Spoofax teams over
the last 15 years, which has provided the foundation for this new
work. In particular, I would like to thank my PhD students and
postdocs, in alphabetical order: Anya Helene Bagge,Martin Bravenboer,
Sander van der Burg, Eelco Dolstra, Danny Groenewegen, Zef Hemel,
Maartje de Jonge,Merijn de Jonge, Karl Trygve Kalleberg, Lennart Kats,
Gabri?l Konat, Karina Olmos, Vlad Vergu, Rob Vermaas, Sander Vermolen,
Guido Wachsmuth.

With a budget of 1,500,000 Euro for five years I can compose a strong
team of PhD students and postdocs. If you have a strong background in
language engineering, compiler construction, program analysis, proof
assistants, and/or mechanized meta-theory, and if you are interested
in contributing to the future of software language engineering,
consider applying for a PhD or postdoc position in the project.

cheers,

-- Eelco Visser
