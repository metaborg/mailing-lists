Hi,

I'm looking for *java-front-0.9pre16621* and
*aspectj-front-0.1pre15717*(since these versions produce different
output from the newer versions).

How can I get these?
Regards.

The numbers after pre indicate subversion revisions. Look for the
appropriate subdirectories of

  https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/

probably get the appropriate revisions of the trunks of these projects
(pre-releases are built from trunk).

These older subversion versions, however, don't have the configure and make
files. How can I install them?

Thanks.

You need automake and autoconf to create makefiles and configure. If
you have the right versions of these tools installed then it should be
a matter of running the ./bootstrap script.

Thanks.

I've installed Java-front from the source file, now I want to install
aspectj-front from a subversion revision. Java-front is perfectly installed.

However, when I run the bootstrap script form the aspectj-front revision, I
get the following error:

*[ identity crisis | error ] No XTC registration for java-front.m4 found
auto-java-front: rewriting failed*

Any idea what this could be? I have correctly configured the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
variable...


Regards.

I thought the error:

*[ identity crisis | error ] No XTC registration for java-front.m4 found
auto-java-front: rewriting failed*

I get when running the AspectJ-Front bootstrap script could be derived from
the fact that I have installed Java-Front via a source distribution and not
via svn, so tried re-installing Java-Front via svn.
These steps run without problems:

*./bootstrap*
*./configure --enable-bootstrap*

However, when I get to run make, I get the following error:

...

Any idea what could be going wrong?

Thanks.

Having a source distribution of aspectj-front-0.1pre15717 would probably
help. Can anyone send it to me?

Subject: [Stratego Users] Spoofax
Message-ID: <4C61933B.40900@web.de>

  Hi,

I started with Spoofax just some days ago, so may be I just did not 
do/know things right...

    * Language-Colorer

       1. Idx: yellow orange  // gives syntax error
       2. Idx: orange bold    // gives syntax error

    But: Idx: :   0 128   0   255 255 240 bold  // works fine

    * AST-nodes - cons attibute - lexical syntax

    Reading the docu 'The Syntax Definition Formalism SDF', page 15, I read:
    lexical syntax
             "a" -> A
    .. automatically linked by SDF by the following transformation:
    "a"     -> <A-LEX>
    <A-LEX> -> <A-CF>
    So I thought, that
    lexical syntax
    "a" -> A {cons("A")}
    would be transormed the same way, means that A would be in the
    namespace -CF (context free syntax) and node A in the AST would be
    resolveable. But this not the case. I achieved this only by the
    following cumbersome construction:
    lexical syntax
             "a" -> LA
         context-free syntax
             LA  -> A {cons("A")}
    In the exports section sorts then would stay LA and A.
    Question: is there a better way (lexical restrictions etc also
    possible for LA)?

    * Error Markers

       1. It seems that the error-detection of testfiles is only
          started, when the file is loaded into the editor.
       2. If errors are detected and not corrected, then this markers
          keep on beeing present even if the testfiles are renamed to a
          extension, for what the editor was not intended.

    * Swapping until freeze

    Accidentally I deleted a line of my grammar file and started the
    build. Then Spoofax worked with full power and swapped out more and
    more until about 3.5 GB, then eclipse freezed. The process was not
    stoppable.

        * Error Log

        An internal error occurred during: "myxy ParserScheduler for
        example.def".

        * Exception Stack trace

        java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
        at java.util.AbstractList.iterator(Unknown Source)
        at
        org.spoofax.jsglr.Disambiguator.filterTree(Disambiguator.java:393)
        at
        org.spoofax.jsglr.Disambiguator.filterTree(Disambiguator.java:362)
        at
        org.spoofax.jsglr.Disambiguator.filterAmbiguities(Disambiguator.java:704)
        at
        org.spoofax.jsglr.Disambiguator.filterTree(Disambiguator.java:356)
        at
        org.spoofax.jsglr.Disambiguator.filterAmbiguities(Disambiguator.java:704)
        at
        org.spoofax.jsglr.Disambiguator.filterTree(Disambiguator.java:356)
        ... and so on

    * Wishes

       1. If Spoofax is in an endless loop of the Disambiguator.filter*
          it should be possible at least to manually stop that process.
       2. It would be very useful beeing able to explicitely start
          error-detection for all testfiles, even if they are not
          loaded. Then in some way it should be signalized that the
          check is finished (or maybe still running).
       3. It would be nice that sdf-files in the syntax folder, which
          are not imported by the grammar, are i.e. greyed out in the
          package explorer.
       4. Automatic generation of completion-proposals according to the
          grammar-definition.
       5. Proven programming conventions for Spoofax.
       6. Some proven project templates for Spoofax - for small, medium
          and big size projects.
       7. Guide for migration of C-stratego-xt projects to spoofax.
       8. Completion-templates: Jumping with Tab to the next template
          paramater as in JDE

    * Miscellaneous

    Spoofax is super 8-)

Thank You very much,

Otto Hausbacher

Yes, this is a known limitation of the current colorer language design. Each "color" yellow, orange, etc. actually specifies a foreground color, a background color, and font styles, and you can't compose them like that. I added a comment to http://yellowgrass.org/issue/Spoofax/54 about this issue.

You can also write something like this instad:

  context-free syntax
    "a" -> A {cons("A")}
    A   -> B

  lexical restrictions %% restrictions for "a", "b", and "c":
    "a" "b" "c" ~/~ [A-Za-z0-9]

  context-free restrictions %% restrictions for A
    A -/- [A-Za-z0-9]

This is an open issue (Spoofax/224).

This sounds like a bug that I haven't heard from before. Could you post an issue report at the bug tracker with the grammar that caused it? Or at least with the complete stack trace?

Your wishes sound reasonable; we've considered some of these ourselves. Could you post them to the issue tracker though, for future reference?

Hi,

Unfortunately, I don't have time to manually build source
distributions for old versions of our software. Perhaps the buildfarm
can be configured up to do that (Rob)? Otherwise, I'd advise you to
try to build the distribution in a (virtual) Linux machine rather than
under Cygwin.

cheers,

I have tried already two times to register to YellowGrass, but without 
avail. The site always says 'text entered did not match text in image' 
though I am sure I entered the correct text. So I cannot post an issue 
report at the bug tracker.

Unfortunately I cannot restore that grammar anymore. I already deleted 
the error log, but the rest of the stack trace were just a a lot of 
repetitions of the two lines:

	at org.spoofax.jsglr.Disambiguator.filterAmbiguities(Disambiguator.java:704)
	at org.spoofax.jsglr.Disambiguator.filterTree(Disambiguator.java:356)

I cannot post them, because I am unable to register to Yellowgrass.

Hi Otto,

With respect to the registration in YellowGrass:

As you already figured out: The error message 'text entered did not
match text in image' is incorrect. If you look higher up in the form,
there should be one or more other error messages near the name, user
name, password or email input box. Please correct these, enter the new
text shown in the image and try again.
The error message for the matching text is always triggered whenever
registration fails. This is a known bug.

Sorry for the trouble,
Sander Vermolen

@Sander
This is fixed in the WebDSL trunk, the problem will go away in the next
plugin release.

Finally got the version I needed. However, installing AspectJ-Front failed
once again... What's strange is that Java-Front was installed without any
problems and it is working.

I'm able to run AJFront's  ./configure (but, even though the variable
PKG_CONFIG_PATH is correctly set, I still had to use the
--with-aterm=/usr/local --with-sdf=/usr/local --with-strategoxt=/usr/local
flags, so that I didn't get an error).

After ./configure, I used ./make and got this error:

Was the installation procedure for older sdf/stratego bundles different?

Thanks.

No, but there might be some subtle incompatibilities between your
aspectj 15717 source drop and the latest sdf2-bundle release (if
that's what you're compiling against).

Looking at your output, it's not obvious what the problem for failed
compilation is. The undeclared sort warnings are benign. The missing
/tmp/StrategoXTmT7aMM is fatal. The reason for a missing file like
this is sometimes a segfault in the program that was supposed to
create /tmp/StrategoXTmT7aMM. That might be hidden inside the make
output somewhere. I suspect the rest of the errors you see is because
/tmp/StrategoXTmT7aMM was never created.

Perhaps using strace would help? Is that available on cygwin?

strace -f make

You probably want to pipe the output through grep,  to look for "-o
/tmp/StrategoXTmT7aMM" or "-i /tmp/StrategoXTmT7aMM". This should give
you an idea of which programs write/read to the tmp file, and might
give us some further clues.

Cheers,

Couldn't find any "/tmp/STrategoXT------" references (the actual
filename changes everytime make is run) in the strace -f make output.

But I thought about incompatibilities between aspectj 15717 and the
latest sdf2-bundle release. I was told to install an older version of
the sdf2-bundle (2.3.4pre15345), but I couldn't install it, so I
installed the newest version. Maybe installing the older version would
solve the problem.

I got this error, when installing sd2f-bundle:

Unfortunately, I'm looking for an even older version of sdf2-bundle.

For instance, the source repository of Java-front is:
https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/java-front/

Is there a similar address for sdf2-bundle?

Message-ID: <4C74CF02.4040503@jaist.ac.jp>

Hi,

Thank you for releasing Spoofax. It is really a nice environment to develop my own DSLs!

I am developing my DSL that is a tiny extension to Java, and I want to use the pretty printer modules provided by the java-front package bundled with Stratego/XT 0.17 to get plain Java code with less effort. Simply importing the modules does not work because Spoofax cannot understand "Stratego-Box".

How can I use/enable "Stratego-Box" in Spoofax?

Thanks,

Tomoyuki Aotani

Hi,

To use the box language embedding in Stratego, you need to have the Stratego-Box parse table in your workspace. You can download it here: http://hydra.nixos.org/build/608298. Just put the .tbl file anywhere in the workspace and be sure it's visible in the package explorer. Then you need a .meta file for each .str file where you use the syntax (if you don't have one already). For example, if you have a foo.str file, you need a foo.meta file in the same directory with the following contents:

  Meta([Syntax("Stratego-Box")])

hth,

Lennart

Subject: [Stratego Users] Installing AspectJ-Front from SVN repository
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=y6NdVDYdXq8fpiVcf2YjW=Mp-FExcsv0ZjEN8@mail.gmail.com>

Trying to install aspectj-front from svn (the latest version ofr instance).

I have correctly installed all the needed dependencies (aterm, java-front,
etc.)

When I run the ./bootstrap script, I always get the following error when
trying to run the *auto-java-front* executable (located in <java-front
install folder>/bin):

[ identity crisis | error ] No XTC registration for java-front.m4 found
auto-java-front: rewriting failed, trace:
main_0_0
main_auto_java_front_0_0
install_java_front_m4_0_0
xtc_find_file_0_0
xtc_find_0_0

Do I need to install anything else or make anything else to register
java-front.m4 in XTC? Has anyone successfully installed an aspectj-front
version by svn checkout?


Thanks.

Hi,

Did you use --enable-bootstrap in the configure flags? According to the buildfarm we use, svn should build without problems.

Gr, Rob

I can't even pass the ./bootstrap step. The error appears when I run
./bootstrap.

Can you tell me exactly what steps do you use to build? Or can I somehow
install your buildfarm?

Or do I need to install something else?

Regards.

This is unknown behaviour. Could you tell me exactly the version you
have installed from all the dependencies and on which system you are
running. Also how you have configured the deps.

I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

I installed *aterm-2.5* from a source package with ./configure
--prefix=/opt/aterm; make ; make install,

*sdf2-bundle-2.4* from a source package with ./configure
--prefix=/opt/sdf2-bundle --with-aterm=/opt/aterm; make; make install,

*strategoxt-0.17pre18583* from a source package with ./configure
--prefix=/opt/strategoxt --with-aterm=/opt/aterm
--with-sdf=/opt/sdf2-bundle; make; make install,

*java-front-0.9pre18737 *from a source package with:
export
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/strategoxt/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/aterm/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/sdf2-bundle/lib/pkgconfig
./configure --prefix=/opt/java-front; make; make install



The above steps were all completed successfully.  Then, downloaded *
aspectj-front-0.2pre17697* via SVN, added what I had to add to the path:

export
PATH=$PATH:/opt/strategoxt/bin:/opt/aterm/bin:/opt/sdf2-bundle/bin:/opt/java-front/bin

and run the bootstrap script (./bootstrap), which originates the error I had
previously reported:

[ identity crisis | error ] No XTC registration for java-front.m4 found
auto-java-front: rewriting failed, trace:
main_0_0
main_auto_java_front_0_0
install_java_front_m4_0_0
xtc_find_file_0_0
xtc_find_0_0

I probably missed something important here, so excuse me for
suggesting something so banal: If you're installing this on Linux
anyway, why don't you just install the Nix packages for everything
instead of building it from source[1]? Would probably save you a
bundle of trouble:)

Alternatively, use the Nix-built packages for Ubuntu.

Cheers,

The problem's that I'm not interested in using the latest versions of
aspectj-front, but specific revisions (for which there are no built
packages). :-(
