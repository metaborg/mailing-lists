Subject: [Stratego Users] 2011 GTTSE/SLE Students' Workshop: Call for
	extended abstracts
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=wAxNN41B1--b5R+=Hq-azMi50Lw@mail.gmail.com>

   * * *   2011 GTTSE/SLE Students' Workshop    * * *

             July 5, 2011 Braga, Portugal

     http://gttse.wikidot.com/2011:students-workshop
             http://planet-sl.org/sle2011/

The co-location of SLE and GTTSE provides us the opportunity to
combine their respective Doctoral Symposium and Participants' Workshop
to form the GTTSE/SLE Students' Workshop.  The students' workshop
features presentations by the GTTSE and SLE participants: PhD
students, PostDocs, practitioners, and other members of the computer
science community.  All registered participants are asked to submit an
extended abstract in one of two forms:

1. Committed junior researchers may leverage the workshop as a means
to present their relevant research and to receive feedback from senior
researchers in the field.  Submissions of this form should be an
extended abstract of 2 pages in Springer LNCS style as a presentation
proposal for the workshop.  This may describe new ideas or early
results, but there are no formal specifications as to the abstracts
content.

2. In addition, doctoral students may use the workshop as a way to get
feedback on their proposed doctoral research plan.  Students should
submit a 4 page (LNCS style, excluding references) abstract based on
the following outline:
- Problem Description and Motivation.
- Brief Overview of Related Work, highlighting the gap the work aims
  to fill.
- Proposed Solution, a high-level overview and any hypotheses
  that you have formulated.
- Research Method, describing how you will validate or refute your
  hypotheses.
It is understood that students at different stages of their research
will be able to make more or less detailed and stabilized
contributions to each of these sections. Therefore, we provide this
outline as more of a guide than a strict requirement. Nonetheless, we
encourage even early-stage PhD students to consider using this
outline.


Selection process for the SLE/GTTSE Students' Workshop

The organizers will select proposals, with assistance as needed from
the GTTSE scientific committee and the SLE program committee, for an
interesting program.  There are always more presentation proposals
than there are slots in the workshop. There are likely to be 10?15
slots for presentations with 10?15 minutes each. The organizers will
select a compelling set of presentation topics. This selection process
is supposed to be informal and must not be confused with any sort of
peer review or selective review.  In particular, no formal feedback is
returned to the authors of the 2 page abstracts. Authors are merely
notified of the selection's outcome.  Authors of 4 page doctoral
research plans will receive informal feedback from reviewers chosen
from the GTTSE scientific committee and SLE program committee.
Authors who are not selected and who still wish to present some of
their material may exhibit (and present) a poster at GTTSE.

All reasonable submissions are distributed in printed form at the
workshop. The abstracts will not be published online. The titles of
selected presentations appear online though. Presenters may also
voluntarily submit their slides for inclusion on the website.


The GTTSE/SLE Students' Workshop will feature an award sponsored by
SIG (The Software Improvement Group), to be given to the best
presentation at the workshop. The awardee will be determined by a
committee of senior attendees that is assembled by the organizers.


Why present at and participate in the workshop?

Each presenter benefits by means of the feedback from the renowned
tutorial speakers and other participants. Presentation at the workshop
may also spark off new collaborations. The school and conference, as a
whole, also benefits from the workshop because the presentations
constitute a blend of the current research interests in the GTTSE and
SLE communities.


Submission

The submission deadline is May 27, 2011.  This coincides with the end
of Early Registration for both GTTSE and SLE.  Abstracts must be
submitted via EasyChair.  See the event web pages (above) for
submission details.


Notes on the GTTSE post-proceedings

After the school, all GTTSE participants (i.e., presenters,
non-presenters, and non-submitters to the workshop) are encouraged to
submit a contribution for inclusion into the post-proceedings. These
contributions are properly reviewed and selection for the
post-proceedings is competitive. Successful contributions have to meet
high originality and quality standards. Compared to the usual
peer-reviewed venue, GTTSE is particularly prepared to provide gentle
and detailed feedback to PhD students. Submissions to the
post-proceedings can have up to 15 pages. A designated call for
contributions to the post-proceedings is distributed after the school.

4th International Summer School on Generative and Transformational
Techniques in Software Engineering

http://gttse.wikidot.com/


SCIENTIFIC PROGRAM SUMMARY

    8 Long Tutorials
    8 Short Tutorials
    Participants Workshop

REGISTRATION DEADLINE:

    May 27 (early registration)
    June 17 (late registration)

SCOPE AND FORMAT

The summer school brings together PhD students, lecturers, technology
presenters, as well as other researchers and practitioners who are
interested in the generation and the transformation of programs, data,
software models, data models, meta-models, documentation, and entire
software systems. This concerns many areas of software engineering:
software reverse and re-engineering, model-driven approaches,
automated software engineering, generic language technology,
aspect-oriented programming, feature-oriented development, compiler
construction, to name a few. These areas differ with regard to the
specific sorts of meta-models (or grammars, schemas, formats etc.)
that underlie the involved artifacts, and with regard to the specific
techniques that are employed for the generation and the transformation
of the artifacts. The tutorials are given by renowned representatives
of complementary approaches and problem domains. Each tutorial
combines foundations, methods, examples, and tool support. The program
of the summer school also features invited technology presentations,
which present setups for generative and transformational techniques.
These presentations complement each other in terms of the chosen
application domains, case studies, and the underlying concepts. The
program of the school also features a participants workshop. All
summer school material will be collected in proceedings that are
handed out to the participants. Formal proceedings will be compiled
after the summer school, where all contributions are subjected to
additional reviewing.

The formal proceedings of the previous three instances of the summer
school (2005, 2007 and 2009) were published as volumes 4143, 5235 and
6491 in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series of
Springer-Verlag.

Dear developers of Spoofax,

I want to map a generated abstract syntax tree of Spoofax to an Ecore metamodel so that I can use it with other Eclipse-MDT tools. For this purpose, I am considering to extend the AST specific Java classes of Spoofax. Please, could you tell me which classes of the source code implement the AST-specific functionalities.

Best regards,
Alexander Kraas

Hi Alexander,

there is already some support for that outside of Spoofax. There is an SGLR parser which returns a model compliant to a generic AST metamodel or to a specific metamodel generated from an SDF grammar. A second solution combines an SGLR parser with a Stratego interpreter. It returns a model compliant to a generic ATerm metamodel or to a specific metamodel generated from Stratego signatures.
Here you can find the corresponding repositories:

	https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/text2model/trunk/org.spoofax.text2model			(needed for both bridges)
	https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/text2model/trunk/org.spoofax.text2model.early 	(SGLR parser returning models)
	https://svn.strategoxt.org/repos/StrategoXT/text2model/trunk/org.spoofax.text2model.late 		(SGLR parser + Stratego Interpreter returning models)

We still need to integrate this into Spoofax. I will discuss this with Lennart. Maybe you can tell us a bit more about your use case/requirements.

Regards, Guido

Hi guys, I am working with grammar extention and I have to extend java
grammar to accept others production (e.g. from a language of mine), and
launch it inside an eclipse editor. That's
why i'm using spoofax, so I can generate an eclipse editor, with at least
the highlighting facility and syntax correction, to my extended language.
The problem i'm facing is that i'm trying to import Java-15/Main Java's SDF
declaration in my language SDF grammar, but the binder reclaims that the
imported module does no match with
the filename.

I've already read the FAQ at Spoofax/Stratego site, but i found nothing.

I hope someone here could help with this issue!

Thanks.
