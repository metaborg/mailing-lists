Subject: [Stratego Users] Changing License of MetaBorg (Spoofax, Stratego, XT,
	...) to Apache 2.0
Message-ID: <CAFaCHU2doQDSYnAAHd3H5WR-AgvrhQKf+Ygxcx5+0psktVzEOQ@mail.gmail.com>

We are in the process of changing the license for Spoofax, Stratego, XT,
and related components from LGPL to Apache 2.0 to encourage further
adoption by industry.

We have sent the questionnaire below to all developers recorded as
contributors in the various github repositories, which were migrated from
our subversion repository (which was migrated from a CVS repository!). In
case you did not receive a direct request, but contributed to one of the
Spoofax/Stratego/XT components, please fill in the questionnaire below and
send it back directly to me, preferably this week.

thanks,

Dear Spoofax / Stratego / XT Contributor,

Spoofax is gaining interest from industry. However, the current LGPL
license proves to be an obstacle for adoption. Therefore, we want to
license all MetaBorg projects under the Apache License 2.0.

We ask you to fill in the questionnaire below in order to realize the
change of license to Apache 2.0 for all MetaBorg software. We would be
pleased if you can return your answer as soon as possible, preferably by
February 26, 2016.

Scope:  In this email we use ?MetaBorg? to refer to all software projects
in the MetaBorg ecosystem as hosted in the github MetaBorg organization (
https://github.com/metaborg <https://github.com/metaborg/spoofax-releng>)
including all components of the Spoofax Language Workbench such as Spoofax,
Stratego, XT, SDF, JSGLR, and other meta-languages (see list of
repositories below).

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks!

---------------------------------------------------------------

Please carefully answer the following questions concerning your
contribution to MetaBorg.

(0) What is your full name and what are your current contact details (email
and mailing address)?

Answer:

(1) Do you agree to license your contributions to the MetaBorg projects as
open source under the Apache 2.0 license agreement  (
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)?

Answer:

(2) Is the code you contributed to the MetaBorg ecosystem your own original
creation?

Answer:

(3) Does anyone else have rights to the code you contributed? [For example,
did you have an agreement with an employer giving the employer rights to
all code you wrote during that time?]

Answer:

(4) Can you estimate how much code you contributed to MetaBorg projects?
[For example, #LOC; or if that's too difficult, percentage.]

Answer:

*Optional:  (5) Do you know of any contributions to the MetaBorg projects
which were improperly copied from someone else?

Answer:

*Optional:  (6) Do you know of any code in MetaBorg projects to which a

# SPLASH 2016

The ACM SIGPLAN conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and
Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of
software construction, to make it the premier conference at the
intersection of programming, languages, systems, and software engineering.
We invite high quality submissions describing original and unpublished work.


## OOPSLA Research Papers

Papers that address any aspect of software development are welcome,
including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation,
generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance,
reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems. Papers may address
these topics in a variety of ways, including new tools (such as languages,
program analyses, and runtime systems), new techniques (such as
methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and
management techniques), and new evaluations (such as formalisms and proofs,
corpora analyses, user studies, and surveys).

Submissions due: Wed 23 March, 2016
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/splash-2016-oopsla


## Onward! Research Papers

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to
do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages,
communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and
more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet
proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and
reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

Submissions due: Fri 1 April, 2016
http://2016.splashcon.org/track/onward2016/onward-2016-papers


## Onward! Essays

Onward! Essays is looking for clear and compelling pieces of writing about
topics important to the software community. An essay can be an exploration
of a topic, its impact, or the circumstances of its creation; it can
present a personal view of what is, explore a terrain, or lead the reader
in an act of discovery; it can be a philosophical digression or a deep
analysis. It can describe a personal journey, perhaps by which the author
reached an understanding of such a topic. The subject area should be
interpreted broadly and can include the relationship of software to human
endeavors, or its philosophical, sociological, psychological, historical,
or anthropological underpinnings.

Submissions due: Fri 1 April, 2016
