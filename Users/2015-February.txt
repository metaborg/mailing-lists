SCOPE

GPCE is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in techniques
that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and component
deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software quality,
and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition to
exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to
foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the
programming languages research communities.

------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------
TOPICS OF INTEREST

GPCE seeks contributions on all topics related to generative software and
its properties. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Generative software
* Domain-specific languages (language extension, language embedding,
  language design, language theory, language workbenches, interpreters,
  compilers)
* Product lines (domain engineering, feature-oriented and
  aspect-oriented programming, pre-processors, feature interactions)
* Metaprogramming (reflection, staging, partial evaluation)
* Program synthesis
* Implementation techniques and tool support (components, plug-ins,
  libraries, metaprogramming, macros, templates, generic programming,
  run-time code generation, model-driven development, composition tools,
  code-completion and code-recommendation systems)

Practical Applications and Empirical evaluations
* Empirical evaluations of all topics above (user studies, substantial case
  studies, controlled experiments, surveys, rigorous measurements)
* Application areas and engineering practice (Cloud Computing, Internet of
  Things, Cyber Physical Systems, Mobile Computing, Software Defined
  Networking, High Performance Computing, Patterns and Middleware,
  Development methods)

Properties of generative software
* Correctness of generators and generated code (analysis, testing, formal
  methods, domain-specific error messages, safety, security)
* Reuse and evolution
* Modularity, separation of concerns, understandability, and
  maintainability
* Performance engineering, nonfunctional properties (program optimization
  and parallelization, GPGPUs, multicore, footprint, metrics)

We particularly welcome papers that address some of the key challenges in
the field, such as,
* synthesizing code from declarative specifications
* supporting extensible languages and language embedding
* ensuring correctness and other nonfunctional properties of generated code
* proving generators correct
* improving error reporting with domain-specific error messages
* reasoning about generators
* handling variability-induced complexity in product lines
* providing efficient interpreters and execution languages
* human factors in developing and maintaining generators

GPCE encourages submissions about empirical evaluations and applications of
generative software, and such papers will be given special consideration
during reviewing.

------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------
SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

Research papers: 10 pages maximum (ACM SIGPLAN style)

Research papers should report on original and unpublished results of
theoretical, empirical, conceptual, or experimental research that
contribute to scientific knowledge in the areas listed above (the PC chair
can advise on appropriateness)

Tool demos and short papers: 4 pages maximum (ACM SIGPLAN style).

The goal of short papers is to promote current work on research and
practice. Short papers represent an early communication of research and do
not always require complete results as in the case of a full paper. In this
way, authors can introduce new ideas to the community, discuss ideas and
get early feedback. Please note that short papers are not intended to be
position statements. Short papers are included in the proceedings and will
be presented with a shorter time slot at the conference.

Tool demonstrations should present tools that implement generative
techniques, and are available for use. Any of the GPCE topics of interest
are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations, although purely commercial
tool demonstrations will not be accepted. Submissions must provide a tool
description of 4 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style (see above) and a
demonstration outline including screenshots of up to 4 pages. Tool
demonstrations must have the words "Tool Demo" or "Tool Demonstration" in
the title, possibly appended in parenthesis. The 4-page tool description
will, if the demonstration is accepted, be published in the proceedings.

Model transformation encompasses a variety of technical spaces
(modelware, grammarware, dataware, ontoware), a variety of model
representations (text, tables, trees, graphs) and a variety of
transformation paradigms (rule-based transformations, term rewriting,
OO manipulations, weaving, refactoring). The study of model
transformation includes foundations, structuring mechanisms, and
properties, such as modularity, composability and parametrisation of
transformations, transformation languages, techniques and tools. To
achieve impact on software engineering in general, methodologies and
tools are required to integrate model transformation into existing
development environments and processes. Four kinds of submissions are
sought: research papers, application papers, exploratory papers and
tool demo papers.

Many dynamic structures can be represented as graphs and their changes
modeled as graph transformations. Theory and applications of graphs,
graph grammars and graph transformation systems have been studied in
our community for more than 40 years. This year ICGT offers two
tracks: a Foundations Track and an Applications Track. The research
papers (limited to 16 pages) submitted for the Foundations Track
describe innovative contributions to current research on the
foundations of graph transformations and are evaluated with respect to
their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Papers for
the applications track can be submitted in different categories:
technical papers (limited to 16 pages), case studies (limited to 12
pages) and tool demo papers (limited to 8 pages).

============================================================


The aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international
research and collaboration on logic-based program development.  LOPSTR
is  open to  contributions in logic-based  program development in  any
language  paradigm.   LOPSTR  has a  reputation for  being  a  lively,
friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress.  Formal
proceedings are produced only after the symposium so that authors  can
incorporate this feedback in the published papers.

The 25th International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis  and
Transformation (LOPSTR 2015) will be held at the University of  Siena, 
Siena,  Italy;   previous symposia were held in  Canterbury,   Madrid, 
Leuven, Odense, Hagenberg, Coimbra, Valencia, Lyngby, Venice,  London, 
Verona, Uppsala, Madrid, Paphos, London, Venice,  Manchester,  Leuven, 
Stockholm, Arnhem, Pisa, Louvain-la-Neuve, and Manchester. 
LOPSTR 2015 will be co-located with PPDP 2015 (International Symposium 
on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).

Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program
development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both
programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large. Both full
papers and extended abstracts describing applications in these areas
are especially welcome. Contributions are welcome on all aspects of
logic-based program development, including, but not limited to:

    * synthesis
    * transformation
    * specialization
    * composition
    * optimization
    * inversion
    * specification
    * analysis and verification
    * testing and certification
    * program and model manipulation
    * transformational techniques in SE
    * applications and tools

Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new
perspective, and application papers that describe experience with
industrial applications are also welcome.

Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in
English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been
published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal,
conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Work that already
appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings
may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions).

English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
style. Each submission must include on its first page  the paper 
title; authors and their  affiliations;  contact author's  email; 
abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist 
the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Page numbers 
should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing 
their report. Submissions cannot exceed 15 pages including references 
but excluding well-marked appendices not intended for publication. 
Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers 
should be intelligible without them. 
Papers should be submitted via the Easychair submission website for 
LOPSTR 2015, which can be accessed through the website of LOPSTR 2015. 


Proceedings

The formal post-conference proceedings will be published by Springer 
in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. 
Full papers can be directly accepted for publication in the formal 
proceedings, or accepted only for presentation at the symposium and 
inclusion in informal proceedings. After the symposium, all authors 
of extended abstracts and full papers accepted only for presentation 
will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions in the light 
of the feedback solicited at the symposium. Then, after another round 
of reviewing, these revised papers may also be published in the formal 
proceedings. 


Special journal issue

After the symposium, a selection of the best papers will be invited to
a  special  issue of  the  'Formal Aspects of Computing'  journal. The 
submissions to the special issue must be substantial extensions of the 
proceedings versions and will  undergo the usual journal reviewing 
process.
