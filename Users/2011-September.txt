#####################################################################

The workshop aims to bring together experts in model-based, model-driven and
software engineering with experts in simulation methods and simulation
practitioners, with the objective to advance the state of the art in
model-driven simulation engineering.

Model-driven engineering approaches provide considerable advantages to
software systems engineering activities through the provision of consistent
and coherent models at different abstraction levels. As these models are in
a machine readable form, model-driven engineering approaches can also
support the exploitation of computing capabilities for model reuse,
programming code generation, and model checking, for example.

The definition of a simulation model, its software implementation and its
execution platform form what is known as simulation engineering. As
simulation systems are mainly based on software, these systems can similarly
benefit from model-driven approaches to support automatic software
generation, enhance software quality, and reduce costs, development effort
and time-to-market.

Similarly to systems and software engineering, simulation engineering can
exploit the capabilities of model-driven approaches by increasing the
abstraction level in simulation model specifications and by automating the
derivation of simulator code. Further advantages can be gained by using
modeling languages, such as UML and SysML ? but not exclusively those. For
example, modeling languages can be used for descriptive modeling (to
describe the system to be simulated), for analytical modeling (to specify
analytically the simulation of the same system), and for implementation
modeling (to define the respective simulator).

A partial list of topics of interest includes:

* model-driven simulation engineering processes
* requirements modeling for simulation
* domain specific languages for modeling and simulation
* model transformations for simulation model building
* model transformations for simulation model implementation
* model-driven engineering of distributed simulation systems
* relationship between metamodeling standards (e.g., MOF, Ecore) and
distributed simulation standards (e.g., HLA, DIS)
* metamodels for simulation reuse and interoperability
* model-driven technologies for different simulation paradigms (discrete
event simulation, multi-agent simulation, sketch-based * simulation, etc.)
* model-driven methods and tools for performance engineering of simulation
systems
* simulation tools for model-driven software performance engineering
* model-driven technologies for simulation verification and validation
* model-driven technologies for data collection and analysis
* model-driven technologies for simulation visualization
* Executable UML
* Executable Architectures
* SysML / Modelica integration
* Simulation Model Portability and reuse
* model-based systems verification and validation
* simulation for model-based systems engineering

To stimulate creativity, however, the workshop maintains a wider scope and
welcomes contributions offering original perspectives on model-driven
engineering of simulation systems.

Hi,

I am using Spoofax - the eclipse plugin - for a while. I wrote an SDF
grammar and a stratego function to process my input into some XML.
Is there any way to export the parser and the stratego files so I can use
them in command line?
I would like to have something like this: "cat input.txt | some_tool >
out.xml".

I see that you have incorporated some of the tools from Spoofax in
strategoxt.jar, but I couldn't find the proper documentation on how to use
it. I could find something on the manual, but I believe this is for an older
version of the tool and don't really match up.

I could really appreciate it, if you could help me with this, or point me to
the right documentation.

Thanks,
Radu Mereuta - Research Assistant - FII UAIC

I don`t know what are you trying to do, but you can have the parser of your
grammar. I`ve already done this, but programmatically in Java, and without
the stratego transforms.

To get the sdf parser,

When you write the grammar of your language in the specific sdf file, and
build the project, so it generates a new editor, it also generates a tbl
file. I`m not sure, but it is something like <yourlanguagesname>.tbl. It`s
in some directory of your project, you just have to search it.

Then, in the library files, you can get the JSGLR parser as a jar, that you
must pass to it that tbl file you just found before.

Now that you have the both, create a new Java project and put the JSGLR into
your imported libs, and your tbl file as an input. For more information, try
to search about the use of the JSGLR.

Then, you have your parser, and you can parse any files described in that
language of yours, just passing them as args in the Java`s main fuction.

I don`t know if there is another easiest way. But i`ve been through this,
and that`s how i`ve done.

I hope it could help you.

I know that I can extract only the parser. The problem was to make it work
from within stratego, as a command line tool. I like the simplicity of it,
it's very convenient. Plus that I can get location information...
I've been playing with strategoxt.jar and I've managed to compile some str
files, but when I call a rule like this:

    <parse-file-pt(|<import-term(include/KSyntax.tbl)>)> "example.k"

in a java file, I get an exception like this:
    Exception in thread "main" org.strategoxt.lang.StrategoException:
Primitive not defined: STRSGLR_open_parse_table
    at org.strategoxt.lang.Context.invokePrimitive(Context.java)

Hi Radu,

To run a Spoofax plugin from the command-line, you need a main strategy 
such as the following (but it sounds like you already figured that part 
out):

         main-minijava:
                 arg* -> arg*
                 where
                 xtc-input-wrap(
                         ?FILE(file);
                         input := <parse-minijava-file> file;
                         editor-init;
                         ast       := <analyse> input;
                         jbc-files := <to-jbc(|<double-quote> 
<base-filename> file)> ast ;
<map(write-jbc-file(| "."))> jbc-files
                 )

I ripped this example from a MiniJava plugin. It uses a helper strategy 
xtc-input-wrap() to process command-line arguments: if you pass it a 
command-line argument '-i FILENAME' then it will assign that FILENAME to 
the file variable.

You can then compile it by adding option '-m main-minijava' to the 
build.main.xml file, build.stratego.args variable.

The STRSGLR_open_parse_table error you get is a strange one. That would 
indicate the JSGLR compatibility library wasn't loaded. How exactly did 
you run your plugin? If you compile it like above it should work like 
'java -jar myplugin.jar'?

Hi Lenart,

I was compiling the .srt file with the strategoxt.jar, and it turned out
that I had to link the libstratego-sglr library at compiling time.
I'm doing it like this right now:

java -jar strategoxt.jar -i xmlify.str -o a.out -m test7 -la
libstratego-sglr

and it works. I get a .java file that I can use later in an eclipse project.
I didn't use a build script, but It seems that it helps speed up things. I
will look into this.

Thanks,
Radu

Have you searched in the stratego documentation?
I`m new with stratego and spoofax, i`m not exactly the best person to give
you any information about it.

In my mind, stratego is only for program transformation. As I could notice
from the sort of entrance you`d like to use, you`re trying to transform some
unstructured data to xml.
Check out this link <http://strategoxt.org/Stratego/StrategoDocumentation>,
it leads you to the stratego documentation. There you can see some libs for
those who want to use the stratego API.

I think it`s the closest I get to help you.

Subject: [Stratego Users] Is spoofax still under active development?
Message-ID: <CAEDkRuyWLNTpN+h2JQgXAfxEAiBx1Be99fdKrD3oAZjY6+7auA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I'm looking at language workbench options just now.  Spoofax looks
interesting - but the mailing list is quiet and there doesn't seem to be
much activity in development.

Is it still under active development?

Thanks,
Scott.
