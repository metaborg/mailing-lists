Subject: [Stratego Users] python to objective C PIL
Message-ID: <20110601125707.PEQLY.72223.root@cdptpa-web02-z01>

I am interested in a subset of Python compiled to Objective C.
The purpose is to port applications to various platforms, including mobile platforms iOS and Android.

I have looked at PIL.  I like the idea, but I don't like the Java syntax.  Also, there are more type declarations than are necessary to translate to Objective C ( in Objective C, most type declarations are optional hints to the compiler.)

I am considering writing yet another front-end from Python to PIL, and then working on the PIL to Objective C backend.

I am also considering just rewriting some of the PIL pieces to accept an even simpler Python-like language.

This is not a criticism of PIL, I realize that everyone has their own idea of what is sugar.  I am writing this email to get suggestions.

My strategy is to develop in Python, a weakly typed interpreted language, and port to Objective C, which also is optionally weakly typed (like Smalltalk) but compilable.  I would also like to port to Java (the Android language) but I haven't worked out the details of that.

Hi,

One thing to consider is that SDF/SGLR are not great with
indentation-based languages like Python, have you looked at that
issue?

Best,

Zef

Hi Giorgio,

In the current version you need to put the Java syntax (Java-15.def, as provided with the Java-front package) in the lib/ directory.

You should also change the build.main.xml Ant build file so 'build.sdf.imports' refers to that file:

  <property name="build.sdf.imports" value="-Idef &quot;${lib}/Java-15.def&quot;"/>

hth,

Lennart

Thank you Lennart, it was very helpfull!

I had put Java's sdf in a folder called 'src' inside the 'syntax' folder of
the spoofax/IMP project. (i.e. syntax/src).
Yesterday afternoon i tryed to mix up everything (the java sdf grammar and
its packages) in the syntax folder and it also worked, but the codes got
messy!
I believe keep the imported files in the lib folder leaves the project more
organized!

Thanks for your support!

=============================================================================

? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? K 2011

? ?2nd International Workshop on the K Framework and its Applications

? ? ? ? ? ? ?August 8-12, 2011, Cheile Gradistei, Romania

=============================================================================

K (http://k-framework.org) is an executable semantic framework focused on the
definition of programming languages, language calculi, type systems, and
formal analysis tools. K has been successfully used for giving the formal
definitions of a series of real-life languages, including (see below for
links):

* C [1]
* Scheme [2], and
* Verilog [3].

K has also been used in semantics-based analysis and verification frameworks
such as Matching Logic [4], and is currently used in language design and
language semantics courses at several universities. The K workshop series
promotes research and collaboration in the area of the development and use of
the K framework.

The topics of the workshop comprise, but are not limited to:

# foundations and models of K;
# languages based on K, including implementation issues;
# K as a logical framework;
# K as a semantic framework, including for
?* object-oriented systems,
?* concurrent and/or parallel systems,
?* interactive, distributed, open ended and mobile systems;
# uses of K to provide rigorous support for model-based software engineering;
# comparisons of K with existing formalisms having analogous aims.

The first edition of the workshop was held in Nags Head (US) in 2010. K 2011,
like K 2010, is planned as a "true workshop", with significant time set aside
for participants to both talk and work together outside of research
presentations.

Submissions and Publication: Before the workshop, authors are invited to submit
an extended abstract of 2 to 3 pages. Accepted abstracts will be presented at
the workshop and included in the preliminary proceedings, available at the
workshop. Abstracts can be submitted using EasyChair at
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=k2011.

After the workshop, authors will be invited to submit a full paper (most likely
of 15 pages), based on their abstract and presentation, which will be refereed
and considered for publication in ENTCS.

Beyond original ideas and recent results not already submitted or published
elsewhere, we also invite authors to submit abstracts describing relevant work
that has been or will be published elsewhere, or work in progress. These
submissions will only be considered for presentation at the workshop and
inclusion in the preliminary proceedings, but not in the final proceedings.

Depending on the quality of the received submissions for the final proceedings,
we envision publication of a special issue of a journal dedicated to the K 2011
workshop.

# Submission of Abstract: July 7, 2011
# Notification: July 10, 2011
