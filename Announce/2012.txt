Subject: [Stratego Announce] Spoofax 1.0.2 maintenance release
Message-ID: <4F3BCCAB.9080701@tudelft.nl>

Hi all,

Today we're releasing a minor maintenance release of Spoofax, version 
1.0.2. This release fixes a memory leak that was introduced in the 1.0 
release. There are no new features in this release, those will be 
included in the upcoming 1.1 release instead.

Spoofax can be updated using the Eclipse update manager, using
the http://spoofax.org/update/stable update site.

cheers,

Lennart Kats
