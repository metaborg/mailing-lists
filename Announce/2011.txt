Subject: [Stratego Announce] Spoofax 1.0
Message-ID: <4EFAFFA4.9090605@tudelft.nl>

Hi all,

We're pleased to announce the release of Spoofax 1.0! A number of 
significant new features have been added since the last stable release, 
a long list of bugs has been fixed, and various minor improvements were 
introduced.

Highlights of the release include:

    * Support for writing tests for language definitions
    * Support for refactorings
    * Major improvements to content completion
    * Support for using rewrite rules to disambiguate syntax

Details are available at http://strategoxt.org/Spoofax/News/.

The new version can be installed from the update site at 
http://spoofax.org/update/stable

In addition to the features listed above, we've been actively working on 
improving Spoofax with new features. In particular, we are now working 
on providing full support for debugging, on an interactive shell for 
Stratego and custom languages, and a new meta-language called 
SpoofaxLang to define languages in a more modular fashion.

A full list of feature requests and issues addressed in the new version 
is provided at http://yellowgrass.org/tag/Spoofax/1.0/.

cheers,

Lennart Kats
