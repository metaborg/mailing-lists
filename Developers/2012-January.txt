Subject: [Stratego Developers] Building the strategies into the .jar for
	org.spoofax.interpreter.library.xml
Message-ID: <CAGxSwVXP3QprdufPrfvPTV6iCfkQWYyr_JGTRzjVW5a=wKDgsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Tobi,

as you might have seen from the -commits list, I am in the process of
breaking the world these days. The next target I've not managed to
sufficiently destroy yet, is your XML library.

Since I do try to exercise some etiquette in these matters, I was
wondering if you objected to me breaking your XML library a little
bit?

Specifically, this is what I want to do:

 1) Add an Ant file so that all of it, including the Stratego code,
compiles inside of Eclipse.
 2) Build the strategies (.str files) into a .ctree file, and bundle
this .ctree file inside the resulting .jar.
 3) Separate the unit tests from the actual API inside parse-xml-test.str
 4) Slap on a license/copyright notice, with your name + an LGPL v2.1
statement (unless you had another license in mind).



Cheers,

-- Karl T

PS. I could be convinced to leave your library alone, and even protect
it from other evil-doers. My fee for this would be reasonable.
PPS. Given the current economic crisis, I will only be able to accept
your token contribution in the form of gold-pressed latinum.
