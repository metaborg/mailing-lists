Hi,

I notice you added SSL_filesize at some point. I want to extend it to
work with already opened files, and I am also adding fseek and ftell
now.

I see that you use reals for reporting the filesize because of the
limitations of ints. Despite the limitation, I want to change this to
int, and rather throw an exception if the file size is >2GB. Do you
know where the SSL_filesize is used? Do we need >2GB support at the
moment? At some point, we must add longs as a primitive term type
anyway.

Hi Karl,

As far as I know, only I have been using it, and I don't use it now -
I only used it (or rather, my original java strategy that did the same
thing) at some point to limit files to convert to those with a decent
size.

So if it's up to me you can change it to int, I definitely don't need
>2GB support.

Uhm, why not use a 'long'?

We don't have a 'long' term type in Stratego at the moment, unfortunately.

That's indeed planned. It's not entirely straightforward, but when we
figure out how to do it with the least amount of problems, we will.

I think it is worth to see if we can solve this in a way that lifts
Stratego to a bit higher level than that of assembler-like
type-suffixed arithmetic operations, e.g. the current addi, addr,
muli, mulr, and future addl, mull for longs... (I know there are
variants without type-suffix.)
More specific, consider how a language like Python does this: there
integers are just that: mathematical integers, not bound by
artificial, arbitrary platform limitations (i.e., max 32 bits).
Implementation-wise it actually *are* 32 bit integers as long as this
fits, and otherwise they become BigIntegers. The point is that this is
completely transparent to the developer.
So here is my suggestion: instead of adding a separate primitive term
type for longs with the accompanying primitives, let's make integers
unbounded by transparently converting between BigInteger and int in
the primitives that operate on integers.

Obviously a 'long' term type could be added too, but that should _only
be an optimization_ for numbers that happen to be in the range 2^31 to
2^63 or -2^31 to -2^63.

Hi,

After lunch yesterday we decided that this would be a decent long term
solution. We also figured a decent intermediate solution would be to
bump IStrategoInt to long internally, as the 4 byte overhead on an
integer that is wrapped in an object would be negligible. Last but not
least we figured that none of us actually need any of this at the
moment, so for now we'll just have SSL_filesize fail/warn/throw on
files larger than 2 GB, and return an integer otherwise.
